    <summary>A new pull request has been submitted to enable the use of compressed public keys in Bitcoin. This implementation allows old clients to verify and relay these keys without any issues. Compressed public keys are 33 bytes long and only contain the X coordinate of the point, while the Y-coordinate value is reconstructed upon use. This implementation chooses only one of the two public keys that correspond to a private key generated with -compressedpubkeys active, to avoid confusion. The reported address for all compressed public keys will be that corresponding to its compressed pubkey. However, it remains unclear whether all client implementations support this feature. Additionally, there are concerns about how secrets for compressed pubkeys should be represented and the fact that send-to-pubkey transactions are currently untested. To aid in testing, an address corresponding to a compressed public key has been provided for experimentation purposes.</summary>
