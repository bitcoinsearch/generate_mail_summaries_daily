    <summary>In an email exchange between Steve Davis and Pieter Wuille, Steve suggested exploring alternative approaches to moving away from RIPEMD160. Pieter responded by suggesting the option of reverting to [, OP_CHECKSIG] but stated that it would not be effective in avoiding the 80-bit collision attack on jointly constructed addresses like multisig P2SH. For single-key ones, RIPEMD160 provides 160 bit security which is more than ECDSA signatures offer. Later, Steve emailed Pieter expressing his concerns about the time it would take to reach critical mass with segwit and asked if there were any other alternatives that could be explored. Pieter responded by explaining that any alternative approach would require drafting a softfork proposal, new address format, miner acceptance, and wallet adoption just like segwit. Therefore, most of the work for adopting an alternative approach is already done with segwit.</summary>
