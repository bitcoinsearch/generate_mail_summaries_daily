    <summary>A new Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) has been introduced, which aims to provide a means of measuring consensus for potential changes to the Bitcoin protocol. The proposal is called the Community Consensus Voting System (CCVS). The system will be open to all users, with each user allowed one vote. However, mining pools, companies using Bitcoin, and Core maintainers/contributors are allowed one confirmed vote each, which is worth 10,000 times a regular vote. CCVS proposes that voting would run for a pre-defined period, ending when a particular block number is mined. Confirmed votes would be added to a new section in each respective BIP as a public record. The CCVS aims to provide a way for developers to show they have given an idea legitimate consideration and for the general public to voice their opinion on proposed changes to the Bitcoin protocol.Despite the benefits of CCVS, some concerns have been raised about its effectiveness. Some believe that an on-chain system like CCVS adds unnecessary complexity and incentives. Additionally, there are those who believe that Bitcoin should be a system of vetos rather than approvals. This approach ensures that important opinions are not shut down by involving money or political power. The issue of node voting has not yet been resolved, and it is outside the scope of this BIP. Although it would be desirable for any full node running an up-to-date blockchain to be able to vote with a multiplier (e.g. 100x), it remains to be seen if this can be implemented.</summary>
