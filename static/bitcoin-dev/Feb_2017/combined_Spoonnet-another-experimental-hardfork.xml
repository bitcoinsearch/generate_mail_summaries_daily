    <summary>Johnson Lau has proposed an experimental implementation for Bitcoin that includes various changes to the consensus protocol. One of the key features of this proposal is a new extended and flexible header located at the witness field of the coinbase transaction. The extended header has exactly two witness items in the coinbase witness, Header 1 and Header 2. The main header commitment is H(H(Header1)|H(Header2)) H() = dSHA256(). Other proposed changes include a fixed starting time, backward compatibility with existing light wallets, dedicated space for miners to put anything they want, small header space for miners to include non-consensus enforced bitcoin related data, and a new optional coinbase tx format that allows additional inputs. The proposed hardfork includes several changes to the Bitcoin protocol, such as Header3 being designated as a miner dedicated space and cannot be larger than 252 bytes. The main header commitment is H(Header1|H(H(Header2)|H(Header3))), and to place the ext header, segwit becomes mandatory after the hardfork. A “backdoor” softfork relaxes the size limit of Header 2 and Header 3 by defining a special BIP9 softfork with bit-15. Anti-tx-replay measures are implemented with a hardfork network version bit of 0x02000000. Sighash limitations are also introduced in the proposed hardfork, where only transactions with masked versions below 3 are counted. New transaction weight definitions are proposed, where the weight of a transaction is determined by the maximum of four metrics. Furthermore, block weight growing by time is introduced using median-time-past, and the new coinbase transaction format allows paying to the child of a particular block by signing the block hash.If the coinbase is in old format, the witness merkle root is the same as in BIP141, while if it is in new format, the witness hash of the coinbase tx is calculated by first removing the extended header, and the witness merkle root is put in the extended header 2. Other consensus changes include ignoring the sign bit in BIP9.The proposed hardfork is experimental, and an implementation of the specification can be found at https://github.com/jl2012/bitcoin/tree/spoonnet1. There are potential second-stage changes that could address problems like SHA256 shortcut like ASICBoost, providing more nonce space in the 80-byte main header, and block withholding attack. All these changes require light wallets to upgrade, and they also require firmware upgrades for all existing miners. The proposed changes should not happen at least two years after the actual activation of the hardfork so that people will have enough time to upgrade.</summary>
