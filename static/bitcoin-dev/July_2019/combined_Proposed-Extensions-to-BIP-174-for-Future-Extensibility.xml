    <summary>The Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) proposes the use of prefixes for private formats to distinguish them from other formats and avoid confusion. Private types should start with a prefix, which would be a string prefixed with a compact size unsigned integer. While not mandatory, it is suggested that private types follow this convention. For public software, there is no need to handle proprietary types, but they should use the proprietary type value. The use of compact size unsigned integers for field types was discussed, but concerns were raised about its compatibility with proprietary use types. To avoid conflicts, it was suggested to use 0xFC followed by a variable length string as a vendor-specific prefix to identify proprietary types. This approach allows multiple types for proprietary use, and a prefix string is optional. Public software does not need to enforce rules for proprietary types.The proposal also suggests reserving certain types for proprietary use, allowing individuals and organizations to attach additional data to partially signed bitcoin transactions (PSBT) for internal processes. The 15 type values from 0xF0 to 0xFE inclusive will be reserved for global, per-input, and per-output types. A global version type and field is also proposed, with a safeguard version number of 0xEF as the key and a 32-bit unsigned little-endian integer representing the version number as the value. This version number is added in case of any backward incompatible changes in the future, and updaters should use the highest version required. Lastly, the canonical method for multi-byte types is proposed by designating a specific type 0xFF to indicate that the type is multiple bytes, followed by another byte to identify the type. While other methods may be more space-efficient, this method is chosen for its simplicity, which allows for easy implementation.</summary>
