    <summary>Bitcoin Core is planning to release an update that will turn off bloom filter serving by default. This feature has been available for many releases and has long been a well-known DoS vector. The change has sparked concern over how it may affect Simple Payment Verification (SPV) wallets and established implementations such as early breadwallet and possibly current BRD wallets.There is a suggestion that the move towards requiring SPV wallets to communicate with trusted nodes could be seen as centralization and breaking functionality without sufficient rationale. However, those who need NODE_BLOOM-supporting nodes can still run a node or two without too much expense.The thread also delves into the issue of traffic caused by bloom filters, which can potentially hinder mobile users and fixed lines in less developed parts of the world. Basic block filters for the last seven days alone can amount to approximately 25MB per week of catch-up if offline for a month. Despite this, there is an argument for prioritizing user privacy and protecting it wherever possible, even at a cost of bandwidth.It is suggested that developers should warn users about the consequences of using BIP37 or stratum/electrum to save traffic. There is also a debate over whether a decentralized form of BIP37 is sustainable in the long run.Finally, there is discussion around the potential for bloom filters to enforce/encourage address re-use as the server decides on the filter and the false positive rate, which could lead to blurred filters and each block being matched, forcing wallets that follow the "one address per incoming payment" pattern to wrap their key chains back to the beginning.It is not anticipated that the upcoming change will result in a significant lack of availability of NODE_BLOOM-enabled nodes in the coming years. However, clients reliant on the availability of NODE_BLOOM-supporting nodes on the P2P network should consider migrating to a more modern, less trustful and privacy-violating alternative over time. Comparing between peers/filter-providers can reduce the amount of trust needed.Currently, there is no alternative available to replace NODE_BLOOM; developers need more time to implement, test, and roll out an alternative. Full node hardware appliances that run at home or in a trusted environment solve many of these issues while adding great features, if done right. It's recommended that users choose the best filtering option based on their needs for privacy and bandwidth availability and also take future usage into account.</summary>
