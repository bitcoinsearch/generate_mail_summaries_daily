    <summary>In an email exchange on October 28, 2014, Tom Harding and Matt discussed the issue of double-spend relay in Bitcoin. Without double-spend relay, miners cannot know that certain transactions conflict with others, making it very dangerous to include transactions at all. If a malicious miner floods other miners with orthogonal double spends, other miners will waste time mining on those transactions before realizing they are double-spends. Delaying relaying/accepting blocks based on information only local to a node creates the ability for people to split the network by sending out many double-spends to different parts of the network simultaneously. Miners are incentivized to connect to everyone on the network and look for double-spends, not including them in their blocks to avoid being delayed. There is a related concept of "discouraging" blocks, but you have to be careful doing that so you don't break consensus.On October 27, 2014, Tom Harding proposed improving the ability of Bitcoin users to rely on unconfirmed transactions. The proposal can be adopted incrementally, with no hard or soft fork required. The proposal is not yet implemented anywhere.</summary>
