    <summary>Jorge Tim√≥n discusses the eventually disappearing mining subsidies in Bitcoin and how transaction fees will always be higher than subsidies. He suggests that a mental model would be to imagine if Bitcoin came with an initial set of nlocktimed transactions that pay fees, one block at a time, for each block from the start until the subsidy goes away. Gregory Maxwell suggests several tools that have been discussed in the past which help address concerns regarding Bitcoin protocol vulnerabilities. These include locktime on normal transactions, having block commitments in transactions, and fee forwarding. Fee forwarding involves miners getting half the fees, while the rest are added to a pool which pays out half in every successive block. However, this class presents the problem of miners demanding users pay fees "out of band," thus escaping the process.Sergio Lerner introduces a vulnerability in the Bitcoin protocol he has been thinking of which may have an impact on the future of Bitcoin, called the Freeze on Transaction Problem. He notes that the use of locktime on normal transactions and having block commitments in transactions can help address some of these concerns, but may not completely solve them. There is also a discussion on the proportion of the network that is "rational" vs "honest"/"altruistic" and the tradeoffs for different amounts of altruism.</summary>
