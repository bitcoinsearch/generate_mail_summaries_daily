    <summary>The discussion is about enabling covenants and the use of OP_CAT. Anthony Towns argues that recursive covenants are already enabled to some extent by multisig, which can be used to enforce KYC requirements. Multisig is more efficient than an explicit covenant since it's all off-chain. This is what Liquid already does, and to some extent, likewise for coins held in exchanges/custodial wallets where funds can be transferred between customers off-chain. You can "escape" from that recursive covenant by having the government change their signing policy. Andrew Poelstra's "CAT and Schnorr Tricks II" post credit Ethan Heilman for originally coming up with the analogy (in 2019). Matt Corallo considers AJ's point to be important as it neuters anti-covenant arguments strongly.</summary>
