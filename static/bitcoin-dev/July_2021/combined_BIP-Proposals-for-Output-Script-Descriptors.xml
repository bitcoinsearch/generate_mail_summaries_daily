    <summary>Bitcoin Core developer, Andrew Chow, has proposed a formalization of Output Script Descriptors in Bitcoin Core into BIPs. These descriptors allow for creating wallet backups and exports that specify the exact scripts, subscripts, and keys to produce. The descriptors are modular and have optional components, so they have been split into 7 BIPs.The first BIP describes descriptors in general and does not specify any particular descriptor. SegWit output script descriptors including wpkh() and wsh() expressions that produce P2WPKH and P2WSH output scripts respectively are also specified. Additionally, pk(), pkh(), and sh() output script descriptors that produce P2PK, P2PKH, and P2SH output scripts respectively are defined. A Tree Expression (denoted TREE) is defined as an expression that represents a tree of scripts. A new expression tr() is defined which takes a key and optionally a tree of scripts and produces a P2TR output script. Two new script expressions, multi() and sortedmulti(), both produce the same multisig output script template and take the same arguments. There may be restrictions on the type and number of public keys that can be included.The backward compatibility of all these descriptors is discussed, and the reference implementation of pk(), pkh(), sh(), and tr() descriptors is mentioned as Bitcoin Core version 0.17 and version 22.0 for tr() descriptors. This document specifies the combo() output script descriptors which take a key and produce P2PK, P2PKH, P2WPKH, and P2SH-P2WPKH output scripts if applicable to the key. Two new script expressions are defined: raw() and addr(). Raw() encapsulates a raw script as a descriptor. Addr() encapsulates an address as a descriptor.Bitcoin Output Script Descriptors is a technology used to describe collections of output scripts and specify key derivation paths. This allows for creating wallet backups and exports which specify the exact scripts, subscripts, and keys to produce. Descriptors consist of several types of expressions, including Script Expressions, Key Expressions, and other expressions entirely.The allowed characters in descriptors must be within a specific character set so that the descriptor checksum will work. The checksum is an error-correcting checksum similar to bech32. It measures mistakes in descriptor strings in "symbol errors". One symbol error is always detected while any 2 or 3 symbol error in a descriptor up to 49154 characters and any 4 symbol error in a descriptor of up to 507 characters is always detected.This document outlines various new script expressions such as pk(), pkh(), sh(), tr(), multi(), sortedmulti(), combo(), raw() and addr() which allow for specifying P2PK, P2PKH, P2SH, P2WPKH, P2SH-P2WPKH and multisig output script formats as a descriptor. Depending on the higher level descriptors, there may be restrictions on the type of public keys that can be included.wpkh() and wsh() output script descriptors are designed for future extension with further fragment types and new script expressions. These will be specified in additional BIPs. Finally, multi() and sortedmulti() output script descriptors are outlined, which take a threshold and one or more public keys and produce a multisig output script. The maximum number of keys that can be present depends on the higher-level descriptors, and the output script produced also depends on the value of k.Raw() and addr() descriptors have also been implemented in Bitcoin Core since version 0.17. The text of all documents related to Bitcoin Output Script Descriptors can be found on Github.</summary>
