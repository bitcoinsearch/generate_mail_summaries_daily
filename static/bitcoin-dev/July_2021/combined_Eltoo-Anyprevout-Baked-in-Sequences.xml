    <summary>The discussion on Bitcoin-dev mailing list revolves around the evaluation of a script that should only return one bit of information "bool tx_is_invalid_script_failed". Other details such as how much is paid in fees, when the transaction is final, if it is valid for a specific chain fork, and who loses or gets funds should be obvious from parsing the transaction. The idea is to make sequencing restrictions clear from nlocktime/nsequence/annex so that one does not have to evaluate scripts/signatures in order to determine if a transaction is final. Overloading the nSequence for a per-input absolute locktime is proposed which would disallow using a relative locktime and an absolute locktime for the same input. However, adding a per-input absolute locktime to the annex could be used to add a commitment to an historical block hash and disambiguate which branch of a chain split or reorg your tx is valid for.</summary>
