    <summary>A proposal has been made to improve sighash malleability flags with the introduction of SIGHASH_IOMAP, which allows transaction signers to commit to a map of inputs/outputs. However, this approach poses some problems such as allowing partially overlapping sets of outputs and quadratic behavior. To solve this, an alternative approach is proposed that disallows partial overlaps and treats the transaction as distinct bundles of x-inputs and y-outputs using the annex field "sig_group_count." A new SIGHASH_GROUP flag is introduced as an alternative to ALL/SINGLE/NONE, which commits to each output in a bundle and avoids introducing many new "unknown key types." This approach can be used to incorporate fees into eltoo with layered commitments. In a follow-up email, the design rationale of the proposal is explained, and it is clarified that the "sig_group_count" lockdowns the hashing of outputs for a given input, thus allowing midstate reuse across signatures input. The proposal is shown to solve other use cases but may not achieve the batch fee-bumping of multiple Lightning commitment with O(1) on-chain footprint.</summary>
