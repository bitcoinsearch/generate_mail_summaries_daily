    <summary>The conversation revolves around changes made in Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) 21 draft. Gary Rowe suggests using unreserved characters such as hyphen rather than colon to avoid conflicts with other URL parameter names. Matt Corallo recommends not using variable names and using period instead of commas in numbers to avoid localization concerns. Amir Taaki discusses issues with BIP 20, leading to a consensus to make changes to BIP 21. Discussions about changing the name of the message parameter to description and making it more descriptive take place, but Matt Corallo prefers minor changes to the BIP.The writer of the email has revised the methods for forward compatibility in BIP 21 by adding new variables either as-is or with a mustimplement: prefix. The old clients that do not recognize the variable after mustimplement: should consider the entire URI invalid and notify the user or drop it silently. Although not ideal, this solution allows for adding fields like expiretime without worrying about old clients ignoring the field. The writer believes that implementing the expiretime field now is inappropriate since some clients already have an old implementation, increasing the possibility of getting ignored.The changes from Bitcoin-Qt implementation to this BIP should be minimal at this late stage of the 0.6 release cycle. The writer wants to get this BIP finalized and implemented for 0.6 so that Bitcoin-Qt will have no version which supports OS URI opening with a broken implementation. The send private key was not in the original specification and is not implemented anywhere and should have been removed as part of the BIP 21 copy/paste. It is now gone.As for the expire time, technically, BIP 21 is still a draft, but it is implemented in all versions of Bitcoin-Qt for drag and drop. Adding a field which restricts the validity of a URI for new clients, but which old clients will gladly accept could result in some ugly situations. Gary Rowe suggested that one never uses doubles or floats for money. However, many people do use them. If one places a sell order on mtgox for $999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999 per BTC, the doublemax trade it actually stores will be displayed.Slush suggested using satoshis instead of decimal bitcoin, but this idea may cause confusion for people working with things at COIN scale. Using decimal numbers allows them to treat the values as strings and avoid arithmetic that will end up confusing them.</summary>
