    <summary>Michael Grønager claimed that the libcoin/bitcoind client could download the entire block chain 3.5 times faster than the bitcoin/bitcoind client, taking less than 90 minutes on a modern laptop. However, another user suspected that the speedup was due to the removal of the secure allocator and fixing the mlock performance bug. The user also reported that in the same time it takes the reference client to fully sync, libbitcoin only made it to height 138k. It was suggested that the reason libbitcoin was actually slower was because it's CPU bound on ECDSA checks, which are skipped in bitcoin in blocks up to the highest hardcoded checkpoint. Michael Grønager claimed that the RPC server in libcoin was blistering fast compared to the Satoshi client and said that the Satoshi client HTTP server executes all rpc commands in its thread, needing to stop the thread of the Node. In libcoin, all the query methods access the blockchain as a const object and they can hence safely query it without intervening the work of the Node thread. The exception is the SendTo methods that first query if a transaction can take place, then pushes it to the work-queue of the Node thread, and exits immediately. There were concerns about removing locking altogether. Gregory Maxwell reported that it took almost exactly twice as long for libcoin/bitcoind clients to download the entire block chain. Another user commented on Michael Grønager's claim about the speedup and asked if he knew where this speedup came from, suspecting that it was not typical for straight refactors to see such big speedups.</summary>
