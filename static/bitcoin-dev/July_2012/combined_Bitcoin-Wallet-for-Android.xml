    <summary>In a series of emails from July 9, 2012, members of the Bitcoin development community discussed the inclusion of certain clients on the "clients" page of the Bitcoin website. Amir Taaki raised concerns that all clients listed should have their source code available for review and run from the source code. Gregory Maxwell agreed with this requirement but made an exception for an Android client because its source code was available and had undergone some review. Maxwell also expressed the opinion that clients with weaker security models than SPV should not be listed unless users could operate their own servers. He also believed that thin clients should have a near-SPV security model and that clients that couldn't be subjected to independent review should not be listed. Jorge Tim√≥n joined in the discussion, expressing his agreement with the need for open-source clients and voicing concerns that proprietary software clients may contain back doors. The group ultimately agreed that they were opposed to including non-reviewable client options or centralized web services on the page without further discussion and requirements being established.</summary>
