    <summary>A user named "grarpamp" posted on a forum that a class of machine had become useless for bitcoin after blk0002.dat was created to store more blocks. It resulted in disk-based overload, leading to all forward progress processing blocks turning into losing ground by 20 or so a day. However, another user with a more recent machine claimed that encryption is not the problem and that their blockchain is on a (userspace!) encrypted filesystem without any measurable slowdown. They pointed out that using ZFS as a filesystem caching implementation is memory-hungry and may have performance issues on 32-bit architectures. The bdb backend Bitcoin uses does many I/O operations and writes them synchronously to disk, killing whatever caching the filesystem provides. The user suggested that some improvements may be coming since Mike has been working on changing the backend from bdb to leveldb, which may (or may not) result in a very different performance profile on the machine. Additionally, they have been working on switching the bitcoin block verifier to use a different style database layout ("ultraprune"), which is smaller, faster, and will support pruning. A recent test on their own machine synced the blockchain up to the latest checkpoint in 7 minutes (6 minutes when stored in RAM instead of disk).Another user shared that their vintage 2.6.20 Linux machine is still staying current just fine despite being substantially slower than the other user's machine, which should be a cause for concern for regular hardware being unable to keep up. They encouraged the original poster to investigate their software configuration, as something is wrong with their system, and it is unlikely to have much to do with bitcoin.</summary>
