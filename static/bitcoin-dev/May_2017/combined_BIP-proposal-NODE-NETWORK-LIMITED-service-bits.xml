    <summary>The bitcoin-dev mailing list received a message from Jonas Schnelli regarding the lack of signaling for valuable service from pruned peers. A BIP proposal was created to address this issue and feedback was requested. The instructions for relay addresses should not instruct users to relay all addresses but rather only those that are useful to them, avoiding unnecessary information being relayed. It is suggested that clients use peers with headroom due to concerns such as reorgs and peak syncing times. Nodes with any of the settings mentioned in the proposal should be willing to serve headers for their entire best chain. There is some uncertainty about the third depth level and it may be best left undefined for now. Nodes who believe they are in sync enough to use NODE_NETWORK_LIMITED_X should treat them identically to NODE_NETWORK in peer selection and disconnect the least useful peers to make room for ones that are more useful.</summary>
