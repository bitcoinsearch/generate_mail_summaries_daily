    <summary>On May 3, 2017, Erik Aronesty via bitcoin-dev suggested adding a payment system to receive historical blocks. However, Gregory Maxwell responded that this idea would result in paying people to sybil attack the network as it is cheaper to run one node behind thousands of IPs than many nodes. The suggestion has come up before.Another idea proposed was that full nodes advertise a bitcoin address and users can send a tip to the peers that served them. A recommended tip of 10mbit should be fine. Full nodes can also require a tip to download the blockchain, but this may represent a barrier for some people to host their own full node. In the long term, this incentivizes quality, long-term hosting and discourages installation spam attacks on the network. Fees for other node operations can be considered if successful. Currently, available connection slots and bandwidth on the network appear to be sufficient to saturate any fully-validating node.</summary>
