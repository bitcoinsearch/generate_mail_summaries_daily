    <summary>The bitcoin developers are engaged in a discussion about the technical aspects of Segwit and its parameters. Sergio Demian Lerner advocates for a consensual hard fork to change the minimum number of lines of code, while Matt Corallo is unconvinced as he believes it would not have broad community acceptance. The conversation also touches on the capacity of Segwit, UTXO bloat potential, and the cost of that UTXO bloat. Johnson Lau clarifies that changing any parameter in a hardfork has no connection with the current BIP141 proposal and suggests using 75% in a softfork, which could be changed later with a hardfork.The discussion then turns to the effectiveness of the 75% witness discount in preventing witness spam. Sergio argues that the current discount only makes the block size worst case worse and suggests a maximum block weight of 2.7M. Gregory Maxwell criticizes Sergio's argument by pointing out that there is a single limit, not a separate, secondary, witness limit. Matt Corallo notes that limiting oneself to just the parameters that can be tweaked in a soft fork is short-sighted. The overall conversation revolves around the potential effectiveness of different approaches to optimizing block size and preventing spam.Sergio Demian Lerner presents his analysis of 1000 blocks starting from Block #461653, computing several metrics, including the supposed size of witness data and non-witness data (onchain). He found that acMainChainSpace was equal to 352608924, acSegwitSpace was equal to 599400403, and the ratio segwit/nosegwit was equal to 1.6999. This implies that the 75% discount is not the best option to prevent witness spam in a block of 4 MB, as stated on segwit.org. Sergio believes that a 50% witness discount is better, and changing any parameter in a hardfork has no relation to the current BIP141 proposal. In conclusion, the bitcoin developers are engaged in a technical discussion about Segwit and its parameters. They discuss the potential effectiveness of different approaches to optimizing block size and preventing spam, as well as the need for hardforks and softforks to make changes to the parameters. Sergio Demian Lerner presents his analysis on witness spam and suggests a 50% discount instead of the current 75% discount. He also encourages others to cross-check his findings with other utilities.</summary>
