    <summary>The Silbert/NYC Segwit2MB proposal has been put forward as a way to potentially trigger BIP141 signaling, which could activate segwit sooner. However, many experts have criticized the proposal for being unrealistic in its timeline and incompatible with the existing deployment. It is unlikely that the hard fork proposed by Barry et al can be deployed on the incredibly short timeline they suggest and meet the requirements of a multi-billion-dollar system.While attempts to design a hard fork tied together with segwit may help, even forks nearly certainly need to activate months apart. James Hilliard suggests using mandatory signaling to lock in segwit with less than 95% hashpower without a full redeployment. It would not be feasible to schedule any hard fork until one can be completely sure BIP141 is active due to activation/p2p codepath complexity. Based on past development experiences, a six-month timeline does not seem to be realistic for a properly tested hard fork.There are several options available for activating Segwit, including 95% of hashrate signaling, deploying BIP148 UASF, redeployment of Segwit on a new bit, or making BIP148 miner triggered (MASF) with a lower threshold. A staged rollout of segwit and then a hard fork would be the fastest available upgrade path for both segwit and a hard fork.In contrast to the Silbert/NYC proposal, the email recommends an approach that involves hashrate participation to immediately activate segwit. The Barry Silbert agreement lacks peer review from the technical community and closed-door agreements between selected participants are not how to garner consensus to change a $30bn decentralized system.</summary>
