    <summary>The Bitcoin community is currently divided over the issue of the Segregated Witness (SegWit) proposal. Around 67% of miners who refuse to signal for SegWit are using ASICBoost technology, which can give them a 20% advantage over their competitors. The use of this technology has resulted in a shift in the balance of miners and has caused concern among those who do not use it.There are three feasible ways of doing ASICBoost: overt via the version field, semi-covert via mining an empty block and grinding the coinbase extra nonce, and fully covert by reordering the block transaction merkle tree. However, if the fully covert method is made infeasible via a secondary merkle commitment in the coinbase a la segwit, and for whatever reason overt ASICBoost isn't used, then empty block mining is still plausible, though presumably becomes unprofitable when the extra 20% of block subsidy is less than the fees for a block.Bitcoin-Dev discussed the effects of a patent on mining ASICs and how it can be blocked through consensus rules. The conversation was prompted by a query about the hypothetical situations where there is no patent, or if an unforeseen future patented mining optimization would exhibit the same characteristics. It was suggested that optional technology with license fees cannot be made available to all miners on equal terms, provided that there is any way for it to be blocked via consensus mechanisms.SegWit was proposed as a partial-mitigation of CVE-2017-9230, or ASICBOOST, which is a severe security vulnerability that is actively exploited. Evidence shows that ASICBOOST is dangerous and its use is already being exploited. It was suggested that this partial mitigation should be quickly strengthened via another soft-fork making the inclusion of witness commits mandatory. However, the security trade-offs of deploying a partial-mitigation to CVE-2017-9230 quickly vs more slowly but more conservatively is under intense debate.The author expects any technical attempt to block ASICBoost use to fail or result in a chain split as it will cause a loss of approximately $5 million per month for ASICBoost miners if they lose 6% of their income. If ASICBoost use is lower than that, say 33%, then the shift in balance of miners would result in a 13% loss for ASICBoost miners, versus a 6% gain for non-ASICBoost miners.</summary>
