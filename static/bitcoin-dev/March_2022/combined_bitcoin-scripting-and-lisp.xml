    <summary>A recent discussion on the Bitcoin Developer mailing list explored the potential of using Chia Lisp to solve the issue of adding new opcodes to the language and enabling upgradability in Bitcoin. The author proposed using Chia Lisp due to its simplicity, which could make certain tasks such as obtaining the sha256 hash of multiple inputs and performing CHECKMULTISIG operations easier. In addition, the author suggested that if the "taproot" opcode is defined to extract the internal public key and merkle path, then the OP_TLUV and OP_EVICT could be implemented recursively. However, the discussion on the bitcoin-dev thread delved into exploring the compatibility of chia lisp with Bitcoin's UTXO model. While Chia uses the Coin Set model, the UTXO model is still relevant in Bitcoin because transactions get passed to a scriptpubkey and it either fails or not.To retrofit onto existing Bitcoin, new opcodes would be added that are special to parsing Bitcoin transactions. The mempool management and constructing more profitable blocks/bundles require the most effort in managing extra conditions. The context also discusses the possibility of adding new opcodes to Chia's language, including support for cross-input signature aggregation and optimization of block weight. Soft forks can be used to define a new version of the language with new opcodes. The proposed Lispy "btcscript" could be designated as different from OG Bitcoin SCRIPT via Taproot leaf version 0xc2.Chia's use of lisp-generating-lisp compression is consensus-critical. In terms of PTLC signatures, they have the property of being indistinguishable from non-PTLC signatures to anyone without the adaptor. However, it's not possible to reveal a secp256k1 PTLC preimage on Chia due to the differences between Chia's BLS12-381 curve and Bitcoin's secp256k1. There is also a difference between Chia lisp with macros and clvm code. While "compiling" is unavoidable, comments in code should not be included in the blockchain.</summary>
