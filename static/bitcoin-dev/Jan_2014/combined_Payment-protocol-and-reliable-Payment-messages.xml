    <summary>Pieter Wuille, a developer of Bitcoin, discussed the use cases of stealth addresses and their benefits in addition to payment protocol. He highlighted the issue with the Payment message fields such as "memo," "refund" and "merchant_data" being useless due to the optional nature of the payment_url in BIP70. This creates an inconvenience for merchants who cannot rely on it to provide an alternative payment method. He suggested that if the sending of Payment is optional, then these fields should be removed and only the transaction be sent. He further emphasized the importance of bi-directional communication in the protocol, which allows for a more secure transfer of funds, especially for anonymous senders. Wuille proposed that the payment message must be attempted to be sent to the location provided, and if it fails, it should be stored in the client and retried later. As an optimization, he suggested that if a payment_url is present, it should encourage sending the payment there instead of broadcasting the transaction on the P2P network. However, this does not guarantee that the payment will be received before the transaction confirms. Therefore, wallets must still be able to deal with this scenario. Lastly, Pieter Wuille acknowledged the issue of payment over HTTP failing, but he preferred the entire transaction to fail in such cases, focusing on making payment submission more reliable. He also addressed the concerns of using the payment protocol for face-to-face payments via NFC or QR, suggesting a Bluetooth MAC address could be used.</summary>
