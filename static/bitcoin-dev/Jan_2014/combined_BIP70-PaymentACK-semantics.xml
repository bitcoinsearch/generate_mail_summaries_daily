    <summary>The discussion among developers of Bitcoin Core in January 2014 centered around the payment protocol being bidirectional. The current specification and implementation required merchants to provide an alternative route for delivering refund or memo information before a transaction is made, as sending the transaction may result in the transfer of funds without knowing what to do with it. Some developers expressed concern that this issue made these fields useless. One suggestion was to have clients attempt to send the payment through payment_uri if specified and make a reasonable attempt to deliver the payment if it has already been broadcasted. Opinions differed on whether wallets should broadcast transactions immediately or wait for a PaymentACK from the merchant. Developers agreed that a way for client applications to interpret the response was necessary. There was some debate about whether merchants should take responsibility for getting a transaction confirmed after delivering a PaymentACK.</summary>
