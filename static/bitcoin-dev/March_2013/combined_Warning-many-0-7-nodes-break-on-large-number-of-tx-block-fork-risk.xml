    <summary>On March 12, 2013, users of Bitcoin software versions prior to 0.8 experienced a bug in which the BDB database ran out of lock entries. This caused some nodes to become stuck around block 225430. The issue affected pre-0.8 and 0.8 nodes, though it was more widespread in pre-0.8 versions. The emergency situation risked having several forked chains with smaller blocks that were accepted by 0.7 nodes. Immediate solutions included upgrading to 0.8 or manually setting the number of lock objects higher in the database. If users were unsure, they were advised to stop processing transactions. In response to the issue, Pieter Wuille asked people to contact pool operators to determine which fork they were on. BTC Guild switched to 0.7 so that the majority of mining power would be back on the "old" chain, which was the one that 0.7 accepted. If miners did not switch to 0.7, it was possible that nodes would start dying en-masse. For those who were unsure about what to do, Wuille promised to follow up with more concrete instructions. Users also discussed the need for more space in the block and proper handling of mem-pool transactions. They suggested dropping free/old transactions as a better behavior than dying. In addition, a scheme where the client dropped all or random mempool transactions would be a tolerable way of handling things. Mempools were relatively small in memory usage at the time, but the risk of them growing was high due to small block sizes. Conflict transactions in the chain cleared mempools of conflicts and kept them bounded by the size of the UTXO subset being spent. Increasing block sizes was not guaranteed to fix usability problems, and it may just make more space for spam. Despite the presence of the bug, the full solution (0.8) was available, and consensus fixing it required a hardfork.</summary>
