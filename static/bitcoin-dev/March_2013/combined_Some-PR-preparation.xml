    <summary>In March 2013, a discussion on BitcoinTalk centered on the risk involved in a block rejection. The consensus was that there was not much risk associated with this scenario as it would be difficult to attack and only those who had not shut down their deposits were vulnerable. It was suggested that someone verify if there were any double spend attempts made during the fork. While there were circulating double-spends visible on blockchain.info, it was unclear if any conflicts had been made into the losing chain. It was agreed upon that it would be good to confirm no one was ripped off, though attempts could not be ruled out.</summary>
