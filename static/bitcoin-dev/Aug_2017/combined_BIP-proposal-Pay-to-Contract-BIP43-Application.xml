    <summary>The email discusses the Pay-to-Contract Protocol, a method for conducting transactions using homomorphic properties of elliptic curve encryption. The lack of a standard specification for these transactions prompted the development of a trade finance application that is BIP43 compliant. The proposal defines levels in the BIP32 path as m / purpose' / coin_type' / contract_id' / *, where contract_id is an arbitrary number within the valid range of indices. The contract commitment address is computed using a cryptographic hash function and partitioning the resulting binary array into parts, converting each part to integer in decimal format, and joining all strings with slash '/'. The rest of the proposal outlines how to compute child public keys and contract commitment pub keys. An example computation is given for the contract commitment address. Omar Shibli shared their specifications in the email for feedback from the developers' community.However, a user who replied to the email raised some security concerns. The user points out that the construction appears completely insecure to him/her. The user gives a scenario where the payee secretly switches the contract agreement and takes the payment. The application and durability issues are also not clear to the user.Overall, the email presents a detailed proposal for conducting transactions using the Pay-to-Contract Protocol, which uses elliptic curve encryption to achieve its goals. While there are some security concerns raised by a user, the proposal provides a starting point for further discussions and improvements in the field of cyberspace transactions.
