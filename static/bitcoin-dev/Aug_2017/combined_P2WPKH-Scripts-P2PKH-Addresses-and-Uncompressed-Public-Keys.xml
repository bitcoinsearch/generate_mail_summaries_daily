    <summary>Bob cannot safely issue Native P2WPKH outputs to Alice if he only has her P2PKH address because it is unknown whether the public key is compressed or uncompressed. BIPs 141 and 143 specify that only compressed public keys are accepted in P2WPKH and P2WSH. If Bob wants to save space, he should first ask for a new BIP173 address from Alice rather than trying to convert the P2PKH address without her consent. The existing P2PKH address format may generally be unsafe to use with SegWit since P2PKH addresses could be derived from uncompressed public keys. It is important to follow the policies outlined in the BIPs to avoid potential future funds loss.</summary>
