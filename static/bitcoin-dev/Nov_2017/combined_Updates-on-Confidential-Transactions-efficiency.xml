    <summary>The email conversation between Gregory Maxwell and a group of people revolves around transaction privacy in Bitcoin. The group discusses various approaches to achieving privacy, with confidential transactions being described as a complement to CoinJoin. Confidential transactions make transaction amounts private, but require a witness for each confidential output that shows it falls within a certain range. This witness requirement increases the size of transactions significantly, but a recent update by Benedikt BÃ¼nz at Stanford has applied inner product argument optimization to achieve an aggregate range proof for confidential transactions with a much smaller size. The new approach can make the bloat factor arbitrarily small, unlike prior constructions.A new approach to providing privacy to transparent cryptocurrencies without any trusted setup has been introduced. The proposed approach includes a zkSNARK construction with value-shuffling, allowing for complex range conditions with logarithmic proofs in the size of the arithmetic circuit representing the conditions being proved. This approach potentially opens up many other interesting applications as well.The worst-case risk of undetected inflation leading to the destruction of a currency is an easily quantified risk: at worst, any given participant loses whatever they have invested in that currency. Perfectly hiding systems do not exist in practice, and no scheme that can be scanned using an asymmetric key will provide perfect hiding. There is also the possibility of having a switch commitment, which allows for computational-hiding-depending-on-the-hardness-of-inverting-hashes while retaining an option to upgrade or block spending via unsound mechanisms in the event of a crypto break.Monero and Zcash are fundamentally less scalable than CT+valueshuffle but more private. The interactive-sparse-in (CJ) has its own attractiveness, even though it is not the strongest for privacy.</summary>
