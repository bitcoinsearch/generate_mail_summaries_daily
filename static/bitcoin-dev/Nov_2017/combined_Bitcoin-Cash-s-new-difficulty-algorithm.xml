    <summary>Scott Roberts, a big fan of Bitcoin Core, has presented a code as a solution to the impending threat to Bitcoin. He acknowledged the failings of previous codes and adversarial nature of some. However, he urged his colleagues not to fall for bait and divert their efforts into reviewing proposals of adversarial competing systems. Roberts was concerned that someone would turn the technical discussion into a political football. Meanwhile, on the Bitcoin development mailing list, Roberts reminded everyone that it is not the platform to give free review to obviously defective proposals of adversarial competing systems. He mentioned that Bitcoin Cash will hard fork on November 13 to implement a new difficulty algorithm, which Bitcoin itself might also need to hard fork to employ a similar algorithm.</summary>
