    <summary>The writer of the email proposes to implement a 3 or 4 digit code generated as a checksum from a BTC address. This would be shown in all wallets next to the receiving address, and when entering a new address to send BTC, the sending wallet should also show the 4DC next to the entered address. This way, the sending person can easily verify that the resulting 4DC matches the one from the receiving address, greatly reducing the probability of performing transactions to a wrong address. The writer suggests that agreeing on a good name for this code would be helpful for fast adoption and that ideally, each cryptocurrency should have its own checksum algorithm to avoid sending funds to the wrong network. However, Pieter, who responds to the proposal, thinks that the purpose of the proposal is not clear since BTC addresses already have a checksum. He explains that an additional checksum is not necessary since comparing any few characters of the address is just as good as any other. Furthermore, he argues that adding a special 4 character "external" checksum could worsen how well comparisons are done in practice.</summary>
