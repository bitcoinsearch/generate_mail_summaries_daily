    <summary>On August 29th, 2021, Prayank posted a question on Bitcoin Stackexchange asking if others think more numbers should be allowed in transaction version by considering such transaction standard. He shared an example of how transaction version can be used to bet on something that involves two outcomes. In the example, an app will save results for `getrawmempool` regularly in local db to check if any transaction wants to participate in bets. A multisig address will be created using two public keys, and the funding transaction will use the version bits to indicate if Alice wants to bet on India or Australia. However, Pieter, in response, stated that Bitcoin transactions should solely contain the information necessary for the world to validate them. He argued that anything other than the two possible version numbers is both pointless and a gratuitous loss of privacy. Pieter also added that currently-unused version numbers may well be used for future consensus rules like BIP68, which any use suggested may interfere with. Therefore, he concluded that versions numbers with no protocol-defined meaning should not be standard as they are reserved for future extensions.</summary>
