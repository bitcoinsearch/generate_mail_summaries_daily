    <summary>Matt Corallo, a Bitcoin Core developer, has proposed a new protocol to replace getblocktemplate and Stratum with a more performant and secure option that moves block-switching logic inside the work provider. The proposed protocol aims to simplify implementation and provide better-defined specifications while offering the ability for a pool to accept work selected by users of the pool rather than the network-level centralization attacks pools can conduct. Corallo hopes that this will create stronger decentralization pressure while still allowing full control of payout management and variance reduction. A detailed BIP draft can be found on GitHub. Clients are not supported in inspecting or modifying transactions, but there is a subscription endpoint that could be used to respond with the current list of transactions and push the diff every time a new template is pushed.</summary>
