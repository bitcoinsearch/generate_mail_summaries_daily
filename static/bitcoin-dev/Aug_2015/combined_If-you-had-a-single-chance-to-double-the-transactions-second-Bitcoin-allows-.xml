    <summary>Sergio Demian Lerner and Pieter Wuille discuss the impact of different changes to Bitcoin's block size and interblock time on mining centralization. Lerner argues that reducing the block rate to half (average 5 minute blocks) would not cause any drastic technical problems, as "SPV" mining and relay networks have shown that block propagation is not an issue for such a small change. He also believes that miners would be delighted as having a lower average block interval strengthens Bitcoin's value proposition. However, Wuille disagrees, pointing out that all problems resulting from propagation delay would be doubled by reducing the interblock time, while doubling the block size has less impact. He also questions the use of SPV mining, which requires trust between miners and fundamentally breaks the security assumption of SPV clients.</summary>
