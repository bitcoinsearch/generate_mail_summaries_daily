    <summary>Pieter Wuille, a Bitcoin Core developer, proposed a gradual increase in the block size limit to 8 MB through a hard fork in the Bitcoin protocol. This proposal was made on the bitcoin-dev mailing list. Currently, the maximum block size limit is set at 1MB in the Bitcoin protocol. According to Wuilleâ€™s proposal, the block size would be increased by 6.7% every 97 days until it reaches 4,096 MB on Nov 17th, 2042. Wuille's proposal also suggested that the hard fork should have 75% miner support and a 30-day grace period before activation. He believes this will provide enough time for everyone to upgrade. Wuille's post highlights that his proposal is a compromise between BIP101 and BIP103, while being mindful of the cost of running a node and keeping bandwidth accessibility in mind.The email exchange between Pieter Wuille and Jiang Zhuoer regarding the increase of block size to 8MB has been made public. Wuille suggests gradually increasing the block size, taking 16 months to reach 8MB, rather than jumping to it immediately. He argues that "demand fills the available space," but the block size and its costs should be constrained.Wuille disagrees with Jiang's idea of stopping mining until the grandparent block is verified, adding that it would reduce security. Wuille also believes that Bitcoin needs to find a future where it does not have to compete with existing systems using their own strengths.</summary>
