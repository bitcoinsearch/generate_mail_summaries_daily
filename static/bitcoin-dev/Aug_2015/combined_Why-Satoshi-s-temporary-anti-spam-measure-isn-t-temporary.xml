    <summary>The discussion revolves around the scalability of Bitcoin and its potential to handle increased usage without compromising its decentralization. Pieter Wuille suggests that the block size should gradually scale over time according to technological growth, with Gavin Andresen agreeing and suggesting that BIP101 intends to do just that. However, he expresses concern about the immediate increase to 8 MB since miners currently don't seem to bother validating blocks.Gavin also questions if a future where miners are even more centralized than now could avoid all problems relay and propagation speed has. He asks about the scalability road map and whether it would be better to wait until Blockstream Elements is ready for deploying on the main network and have one grand hardfork that introduces all the scalability work theyâ€™ve been working on (like Segregated Witness and Lightning). Pieter responds that Lightning does not require a hard fork except that larger blocks would be very useful for its bulk settlements.In another conversation, Mike Hearn mentions that it wasn't well understood that users of Bitcoin would wish to protect its decentralization by limiting the size of the chain to keep it verifiable on small devices. Gregory Maxwell responds that it was indeed well understood and quotes Satoshi's words. Mike Hearn calls him out for obscuring the issue and emphasizes that the founding vision of the project brought everyone together and gave them all a shared goal.Owen via bitcoin-dev disagrees with Mike Hearn's analysis of the highest Bitcoin transaction fees possible and says that given Bitcoin's advantages, there is no reason to believe the marginal cost of a transaction can't far surpass that of a PayPal or bank transfer. He adds that Bitcoin is much more than just a payment technology and that without its attributes, it's merely an inefficient way to do payments.There is concern that increasing the resource utilization of Bitcoin could lead to a more centralized mode and drive the system towards a state where it is only viable in a centralized mode. The trend towards mining centralization is a result of various forces, many of which are modulated by the very things being discussed. The fixation on Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) has been questioned, as it is currently limited by certain assumptions that have been provably violated.The creator of Bitcoin did not expect every consensus decision to be put into the system, and it was well understood that limiting the size of the chain was necessary to keep it verifiable on small devices. While there was a clear expectation that all who ran nodes would mine, the delegation of consensus to third parties was unforeseen. The incentives of the system demand many other economically significant parties run nodes to keep the half dozen miners from having a blank check to do whatever they want.The blockchain provides utility at every size, and the "demand for payments" should be considered infinite, but any finite size will permit some use cases and not others. Pieter believes the benefit of an 8MB over a 1MB in terms of utility is marginal, and the risks of trying to make a controversial change to the network far outweighs the benefits of a small constant factor that "kicks the can down the road". Let's scale the block size gradually over time, according to technological growth. It is suggested that accommodating people with different preferences under one tent is possible, rather than fragmenting the marketplace through the creation of alternative coins. Arguments from authority are deemed abhorrent and undermine the unique value of Bitcoin.</summary>
