    <summary>The debate over the maximum block size for Bitcoin has been ongoing for some time. Recently, Pieter Wuille, a Bitcoin Core developer, argued against increasing the block size limit. He believes that any increase would create higher centralization pressure, which is not worth the risk of losing the balance between utility and risk. Wuille emphasizes that consensus rules are what keep the system together; therefore, changes should only be made when they are uncontroversial.Wuille's main point is that we should aim to do a block size increase for the right reasons. Reliability will always be an issue for cheap transactions, so an evolution towards a specific higher feerate needs to happen. He warns that we should accept that there is never a guarantee for reliability unless you're willing to pay more than everyone else.The discussion around raising the maximum block size centers on whether demand is infinite if a fee minimum is not set or if it's better to act out of fear. It is suggested that blocks should be increased in response to such scenarios while considering the costs and benefits. The best money will win, and if Bitcoin doesn't increase capacity, it won't remain the best.Bitcoin can only be considered better money than current money even if more expensive to transact because of its other great characteristics like trustlessness and limited supply. However, it may not remain the best if something else is less expensive but shares the same characteristics. The compromise may not be at the optimal place, but the technology can "do" gigabyte blocks if you accept that you need a small cluster to keep up with validation, and all blocks are produced by a single miner cartel.</summary>
