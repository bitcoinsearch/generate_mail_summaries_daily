    <summary>The bitcoin-dev mailing list has been discussing a proposed new BIP for CheckSequenceVerify, which allows the creation of transactions that are only valid after a certain time has passed or a certain block height is reached. The discussion centers around whether to invert the current order of sequence numbers for CSV so that successful versions increase and the highest possible number signifies no delay because it is the shortest delay. One suggestion is to represent one block with more than one increment, leaving additional space for future signaling or higher resolution numbers for a share chain commitment. There is also concern about Lightning needing mitigations for a systemic supervillain attack that attempts to flood the network with transactions, which could hypothetically be mitigated with something like a timestop bit, though this proposal includes no such provision. Other suggestions include outsourcing the response to an attack to a third party or engineering ways for users to respond by default even if their wallet is offline or assuring sufficient coordination in the event of a bad hub.</summary>
