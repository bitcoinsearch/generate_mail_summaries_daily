    <summary>The email thread from bitcoin-dev mailing list starts with a comment by Dave Scotese who questions whether miners can unilaterally make changes to Bitcoin's consensus rules. He points out that if the miners are a closed group and adhere to the 51% rule, they could do so. However, he also questions whether miners use full nodes for propagation as anyone can vote by coding. Pieter Wuille responds by clarifying that miners don't need to use full nodes for propagation and miners don't care when other full nodes hear about their blocks, only whether they eventually accept them. He also states that full nodes can change what blocks they accept, which is called a hard fork.The email thread then moves to a proposal by jl2012 via bitcoin-dev to wrap up the endless debate on candidate proposals for Bitcoin's economic policy with voting by different stakeholder groups. The proposal includes several voter groups such as miners, Bitcoin holders, developers, exchanges, merchants and service providers, and full nodes operators. Each group has specific eligibility criteria and voting methods, including digital signatures, multi-sig, P2SH, and publicly known private key. The proposal suggests using single transferable vote for counting and interpreting the results.The proposal also highlights some technical issues, including the need for a trusted person to verify voters' identity and collect votes from different groups. For Bitcoin holders, an automatic system may be required to collect and count the votes due to the potential workload. The proposal addresses the issue of double voting and multiple identities for people who have multiple roles in the Bitcoin ecology.Pieter Wuille responds to the proposal by withdrawing his proposal from the self-appointed vote. He argues that Bitcoin's consensus rules are not a democracy but a consensus system. He suggests finding a solution that everyone agrees on or not.</summary>
