    <summary>In an email exchange, Peter R raises concerns about Gregory Maxwell's paper on transaction fees. He accuses Maxwell of forwarding their private conversation without permission and points out some flaws in his work on blockchain technology. According to Peter, Maxwell had made several assumptions in his work that undermine it completely. These assumptions include assuming that miners cannot change their level of centralization and that the supply of bitcoin is infinite, not declining geometrically.Peter also argues that the amount of information that needs to be transmitted when a block is discovered is not proportional to the block's size, but can be transmitted in advance. He contacted Maxwell privately to improve their collective understanding and received assurances from him that certain corrective actions would be taken. However, as far as Peter knows, none of those actions have been taken. When another author extended Maxwell's work without being made aware of these issues, Peter forwarded their complete discussion to the other author, including comments about Maxwell's public statements seemingly contradicting his commitments to Peter. Peter apologizes for any injury caused by sharing the private correspondence with the other author, but believes that intellectual progress requires sharing such information. He also suggests that Maxwell's prior proposed corrective actions seemed sufficient and that they should focus on implementing improved relaying.Maxwell responds to Peter's concerns, defending the assumptions made in his paper and arguing that Peter's objections are based on hypothetical situations that may never occur. He also accuses Peter of demanding weaker assumptions in his correction than those used in the original paper. Maxwell maintains that his work follows logically from the assumptions made and that the communication scheme suggested by Peter is already physically possible. He adds that the network moving into such a configuration is plausible, as advanced information techniques are already used in every widely-used mining protocol.In summary, the email exchange between Peter R and Gregory Maxwell revolves around concerns raised by Peter about Maxwell's paper on transaction fees. Peter accuses Maxwell of forwarding their private conversation without permission and highlights some flaws in his work. Maxwell defends the assumptions made in his paper and argues that Peter's objections are based on hypothetical situations that may never occur. Despite receiving assurances from Maxwell that certain corrective actions would be taken, Peter is not sure if any of those actions have been implemented.</summary>
