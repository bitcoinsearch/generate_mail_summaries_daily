    <summary>The conversation between Tamas Blummer and Matt Corallo on the bitcoin-dev mailing list is focused on the idea of creating a libconsensus. While Jorge Timón suggests extracting the consensus rules from Bitcoin Core so that nobody needs to re-implement them again, Tamas Blummer's goal is to have compatibility with Bitcoin as well as the ability to create and serve other block chains with other rules. He does not want to carry on the legacy of an antique tool set and a spaghetti style, but instead aims for isolation of bitcoin specific decisions and algos from generic block chain code. Matt Corallo agrees that a libconsensus would not have any kind of networking layer and ideally should have a simple API to give it blocks and inform you of what the current chain is. Additionally, he suggests that maybe it has pluggable block storage, too. Tamas Blummer believes that a slim API server was a lower hanging fruit in Core’s case, while Matt thinks that a good development tool for C++ can be helpful in support for refactoring.</summary>
