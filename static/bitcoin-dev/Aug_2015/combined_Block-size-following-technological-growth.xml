    <summary>The email conversation between Gavin Andresen and Pieter Wuille on the bitcoin-dev mailing list is discussing the pros and cons of increasing the block size limit of Bitcoin. Andresen thinks that a proposal to increase the block size limit to 2 MB by 2021 is too conservative and that it will make the blockchain into a settlement network only for large-value transactions. He believes that even if everyone starts paying fees, lightning networks work great, and sidechains work, there still needs to be an increase in the volume of Bitcoin transactions by an order of magnitude within a year or so.On the other hand, Wuille's proposal tries to address the issue of being locked at the same scale while technology evolves, but intentionally does not try to improve a small factor, as he does not believe it is valuable. The email conversation discusses the value of competition for block space and how consensus rules about the block size are a choice the community makes about the rules of the system they want to use.The debate around increasing the maximum block size of Bitcoin has been ongoing for some time. While some believe that evolving towards an ecosystem where there is competition for block space is unhealthy, others argue that developing a fee market and an ecosystem that can cope with block space competition is necessary. One proposed BIP suggests that no hard forking change that relaxes the block size limit can be guaranteed to provide enough space for every possible demand.Furthermore, the development of a fee market and the evolution towards an ecosystem that is able to cope with block space competition should be considered healthy. However, some critics have pointed out that the mining landscape is already highly centralized, with outsourcing of full validation on the rise, and that increasing the block size may only exacerbate this issue. While there is disagreement between those who want to see the block size remain artificially constrained and those who seek to remove it entirely, many in the community support a one-time increase to 8MB. Ultimately, the decision will need to balance the needs of existing and future users with concerns over mining centralization.Gavin Andresen, a Bitcoin developer, has thanked Pieter Wuille for making a concrete proposal on how to increase the block size limit in Bitcoin. However, Andresen believes that the proposed limit of 2MB by 2021 is conservative and could result in the main blockchain becoming a settlement network only affordable for large-value transactions. He thinks it would be better to have a functioning economy where fees support the security of a transparent network. Andresen also discusses mining centralisation and the need for infrastructure in the Bitcoin community.Pieter Wuille, a Bitcoin Core developer, has shared his proposal for long-term scalability. The proposal seeks to strike the right balance between centralisation of payments and mining. Wuille believes that centralisation of mining is already terrible and there is no need to make it worse. On the other hand, not every transaction fits on the blockchain, so we should accept this fact. Wuille's proposal does not compromise the security of the main layer, or promise the ecosystem unrealistic growth of space for on-chain transactions.Instead, he suggests that the only ones that will fit are large settlements between layer-2 services, and maybe it will be something entirely different. Wuille thinks that Bitcoin needs to support a large scale, as it already failed. A proposal for increasing block size by Gavin Andresen has faced criticism from Wuille. He believes that the numbers don't matter much as the market will fill up whatever space is available. Andresen proposed that the "market minimum fee" should be determined by the market.However, Wuille partially agrees with him, saying that the community should decide what risks it is willing to take, and let the market decide how that space is best used. Wuille also notes that the mining landscape is already very centralised, with apparently a majority depending on agreements to trust each other's announced blocks without validation. He thinks that if miners need to form alliances of trusting each other's blocks without validation to overcome the inefficiencies of slow block propagation, then the system is in direct conflict with the word "permissionless." Furthermore, he believes that the blockchain only offers one trade-off between centralisation and scalability, and for better or for worse, we need different trade-offs and the blockchain is just one, but a very fundamental one.</summary>
