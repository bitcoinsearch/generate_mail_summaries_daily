    <summary>Bitcoin v0.3.23 has been released with some minor updates to the released files. The update includes a regenerated Linux tarball with a properly named directory inside, Win32 .zip archive added and PGP-signed SHA1SUM.asc added to SF. The release aims to deal with the influx of new bitcoin users, and priority for the next version is wallet encryption.P2P connect-to-node logic has changed to reduce timeout a bit. Transaction fee reduced to 0.0005 for new transactions and the client will relay transactions with fees as low as 0.0001 BTC. There have been some fee confusion recently, but free transactions are supported and relayed as they always have been according to special anti-spam rules. The release includes full git changelog. Checksums were updated, and a PGP-signed SHA1SUM.asc added to SF. No changes occurred between the -rc1 and -final versions. Wallet encryption is the priority for the next version.</summary>
