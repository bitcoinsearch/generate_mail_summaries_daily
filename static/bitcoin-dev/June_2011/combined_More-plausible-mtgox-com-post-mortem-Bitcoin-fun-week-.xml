    <summary>In June 2011, security vulnerabilities were disclosed in the MtGox Bitcoin exchange. One of these vulnerabilities was a suspected SQL injection vulnerability that was not patched at the time of the market crash and database leak. It was believed that this vulnerability could have been used to dump the user table.On June 17, 2011, dozens of MTGOX hashed passwords were quietly disclosed on a hash cracking forum. It was suspected that this post may have been generated from an earlier dump than was disclosed on other forums after the big event. Many other MtGox users claimed that their accounts were robbed prior to the big event on Sunday, which would have been too early to be results of the MtGox database leak according to the official timeline re: auditor compromise.In addition, it was found that MtGox exposed its admin user interface even if a user did not have the admin flag set on their account. As of the time of disclosure, most actions attempted to be used would throw permission errors. However, this could not be confirmed at that time.MagicalTux, the operator of MtGox, had claimed that "The site was not compromised with a SQL injection as many are reporting, so in effect the site was not hacked." However, these claims were disputed by several users and security experts. The logs detailing these vulnerabilities were made public and were mirrored on various websites.A post shared by "georgeclooney" suggests that the majority of hashes match the mtgox database that was posted on various forums and websites. Doug Huff shared two independent sources that claim known SQLi vulnerabilities in MtGox, one of which was confirmed to be patched on the 16th. The post also includes MagicalTuxâ€™s official response to the situation, chat logs, and POC for referenced XSS+CSRF. The post concludes with attachments of smime.p7s and PGP.sig.</summary>
