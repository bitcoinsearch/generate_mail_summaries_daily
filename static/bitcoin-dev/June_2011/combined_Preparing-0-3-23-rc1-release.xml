    <summary>The current git HEAD has been proposed to Gavin and the rest of the development team as 0.3.23-rc1. Once Gavin approves, the builds will be ready to upload. The focus of this release was to fix bugs quickly, with an emphasis on resolving issues where connections were taking too long due to network portions not accepting incoming TCP connections. The git shortlog for 0.3.23-rc1 includes various updates and fixes from different contributors. For instance, Doug Huff fixed rfc1918 and rfc3927 compliance for ignoring non-internet-routable hosts, added common temp files to .gitignore, and demystified a few magic numbers. Han Lin Yap added a Swedish translation and removed an unused variable. Jeff Garzik bumped the version to 0.3.23, reduced the minimum TX fee for new transactions to 0.0005, lowered the minimum relay TX fee to 0.0001 (from 0.0005) BTC, and added minimal release process docs. Matt Corallo fixed a CPU usage bug when using -nolisten and having no connections. Nils Schneider created keypool in LoadWallet(). Pieter Wuille updated transactions that were already in the wallet when rescanning, fixed small change outputs, and made timeout faster when connecting.</summary>
