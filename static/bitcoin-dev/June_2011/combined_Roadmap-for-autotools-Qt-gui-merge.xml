    <summary>The discussion thread from 2011-06-17 to 2011-06-19 talks about the possible merge of Autotools and Qtgui. Pieter Wuille is in favor of merging Autotools as long as there are no known issues with it, while Jaromil has his Autotools branch rebased against git master, including Mark's NOSIGPIPE/NOSIGNAL patch. Jaromil encourages developers to test if this compiles + works on several platforms such as Ubuntu, Fedora, mingw crosscompile, osx, among others. The link to Jaromil's Github repository is provided for more details. Pieter suggests marking the changes as "experimental" and not enabled by default. However, he notes that the cleanup of RPC/GUI code will now need changes in three places instead of two. Finally, Pieter asks if anyone on the list would be willing to test Autotools on either a native Windows or OSX platform since it apparently isn't tested enough on these platforms.</summary>
