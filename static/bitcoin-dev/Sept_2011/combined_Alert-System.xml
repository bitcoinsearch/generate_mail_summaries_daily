    <summary>In 2011, there was a discussion among the Bitcoin community regarding the potential for abuse of the alert protocol. Some suggested it might carry the potential for spam/DoS attacks, while others argued that it's merely deprecated. David Perry forked bitcoin/bitcoin, removed the snippet of code from main.cpp that makes the questionable call and submitted a pull request. Gavin Andresen noted that it merited discussion and some kind of consensus should be reached before acting on that pull request. It was also mentioned that he thought the feature was still more useful than dangerous and that he would argue against. There have been suggestions to use the alert system to ask people to upgrade to recent versions of the client. Pieter felt that there may come a moment when they really need to use it for that purpose. Satoshi transferred the key to Gavin when he "left". Pieter agreed that they should keep it. However, David Perry raised a concern that if missing Mr. Satoshi had his key compromised, then they could see an authoritative-looking alert come up from a malicious source. When questioned if anyone aside from Satoshi actually has the ability to send such an alert, Gavin confirmed that he does. He further added that he highly doubts that satoshi would let his key get compromised. Meh, why make the key-holder send out two alerts for old clients and new clients. That said, keep in mind they are literally just messages, they make no functional difference.</summary>
