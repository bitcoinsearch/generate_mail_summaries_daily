    <summary>Pieter Wuille, a Bitcoin Core developer, shared an idea on GitHub, concerning the standardization of part of out-of-band communication using a protocol. Wuille proposed moving away from static Bitcoin addresses and making transactions more transparent by establishing bidirectional communication. He suggested that if you want a freshly negotiated key each time, some form of bidirectional communication is necessary anyway, and a static txout template does not suffice anymore. By adding signatures to authenticate the whole process, it makes sure the client is communicating with whom he thinks he is, and by using them for the submission of the transaction as well, it gives the client proof of payment acceptance too. The third step is that the receiver can track the transaction by asking nodes not to broadcast their transaction but instead just send it back. Furthermore, by passing tags along, identification of transactions becomes a lot easier.</summary>
