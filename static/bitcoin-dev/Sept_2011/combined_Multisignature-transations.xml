    <summary>In this email conversation, Gavin Andresen and Mike Hearn discuss the addition of new transaction types in Bitcoin. Gavin Andresen believes that 2 of 3 is a more useful example than (a or b) as it is the prototype for a normal escrow transaction and only results in three addresses and at most two signatures like the (A and B) or C case. He also mentions that accepting this does not preclude adding more 'standard' transaction types in the future. On the other hand, Mike Hearn inquires whether dispute mediation (2-of-3) will not be supported with the plan to allow CHECKMULTISIG for smallish numbers of keys. The ease of omitting useful cases is why Gavin strongly supports the full RPN boolean validation despite it being harder to get good testing confidence. In conclusion, both parties discuss the implications of different transaction types in Bitcoin.</summary>
