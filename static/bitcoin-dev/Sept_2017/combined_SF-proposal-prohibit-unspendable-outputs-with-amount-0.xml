    <summary>In a Bitcoin-dev discussion, Peter Todd expressed disagreement with a proposal to require at least 1 satoshi per output as it would not make sense from a cost-benefit perspective. However, he did agree that dropping zero value outputs is a needless loss of flexibility and suggested that something similar could be done for increased precision in the future. Currently, allowing spendable outputs with null amounts does not do much against spam attacks to the utxo, but requiring at least 1 satoshi per output could slightly improve the situation. There is no priority or significant importance to this issue, but if there is no reason or use case to keep allowing null amount outputs, a BIP could be created to address it.</summary>
