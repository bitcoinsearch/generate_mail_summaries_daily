    <summary>In a Bitcoin development mailing list, Tim Ruffing raised concerns over potential license violations in some icons used in the Bitcoin codebase. Specifically, he pointed out that certain icons based on Stephan Hutchings Typicons were listed as "License: MIT," which could be a violation of CC BY-SA if not properly licensed. However, it was later discovered that the icons had been relicensed by the copyright holder. Another discussion on the mailing list revolved around a comment referencing "A fast alternative to the modulo reduction." The comment in question referred to cuckoocache.h, and according to Cory Fields, who wrote and submitted the comment, it was unrelated to the code but just a found-on-the-internet explanation for an old and well-known technique. Fields added the comment after encountering people confused with their code in another project.</summary>
