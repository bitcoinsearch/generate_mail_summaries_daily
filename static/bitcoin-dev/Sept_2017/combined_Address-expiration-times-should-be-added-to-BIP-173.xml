    <summary>In a bitcoin-dev email thread, the issue of re-using old addresses that have lost or stolen private keys was discussed. The idea of adding dates and explicit amounts to Bech32 address format for better error correction performance was considered, but the potential delay in adoption due to different software requirements and layering was a concern. While high precision expiration times were suggested, it may not be useful due to clock skew. Another proposal involved sending wallets checking if an address has been used before, but this would be harmful for scalability and privacy. Andreas Schildbach pointed out that support does not equate to usage. Peter Todd explained how an embedded amount in the address checksum could prevent errors caused by typos or cosmic rays.</summary>
