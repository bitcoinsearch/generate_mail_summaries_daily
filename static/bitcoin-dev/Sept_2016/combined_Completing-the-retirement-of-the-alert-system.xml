    <summary>The alert system, which was a central facility for trusted parties to send messages to wallet software, has been removed from Bitcoin Core due to problems with its scalability and accountability. The system was also the source of misunderstanding about the security model and governance, leading to proposals to use it for fee control and remote changes to difficulty. There is also evidence that the key used by the system has been compromised, so it is time to fully deactivate it. The plan is to send a maximum sequence alert, followed by a revocation message, before publishing the private key after a few months. While this may cause some small disruption to production systems that automatically shut down when there is an alert, it will eliminate any further potential of reputation attacks and reduce the risk of misunderstanding the key as a special trusted source of authority. The final alert will be propagated to old protocol version peers to improve the likelihood of continued propagation.</summary>
