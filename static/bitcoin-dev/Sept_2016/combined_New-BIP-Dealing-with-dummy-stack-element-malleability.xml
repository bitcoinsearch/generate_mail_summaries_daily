    <summary>The proposed changes to the Bitcoin transaction validity rules are aimed at fixing the malleability of extra stack element for OP_CHECKMULTISIG and OP_CHECKMULTISIGVERIFY. To fix the dummy element malleability, a new consensus rule ("NULLDUMMY") is deployed to require that the dummy element MUST be the empty byte array. This BIP will be deployed by "version bits" BIP9 using the same parameters for BIP141 and BIP143 with the name "segwit" and using bit 1. The NULLDUMMY rule applies to OP_CHECKMULTISIG and OP_CHECKMULTISIGVERIFY in pre-segregated scripts, and also pay-to-witness-script-hash scripts described in BIP141. Although it was originally planned to do the LOW_S and NULLDUMMY (BIP146) together with segwit in 0.13.1, as they discovered some undocumented behavior in LOW_S, the LOW_S softfork may be deployed in a later release. A design flaw in OP_CHECKMULTISIG and OP_CHECKMULTISIGVERIFY makes them consume an extra stack element ("dummy element") after signature validation. It is technically possible to bundle 2 independent softforks in one release, but it increases the burden of testing and maintenance. Therefore, two independently softforks would double the risks, and NULLDUMMY alone is not worth the risks. Although softfork activation could be risky, there has been no transactions violating the requirement being added to the chain since at least August 2015. This document specifies proposed changes to the Bitcoin transaction validity rules to fix the malleability of extra stack element for OP_CHECKMULTISIG and OP_CHECKMULTISIGVERIFY. An implementation for the reference client is available at https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8636. This document is extracted from the previous BIP62 proposal, which was composed by Pieter Wuille and had input from various people. This document is placed in the public domain.</summary>
