    <summary>On September 23, 2016, Russell O'Connor raised concerns about a proposed Bitcoin script feature that could affect the system's current fungibility. The feature in question involves referencing previous blocks to invalidate coins and prevent double-spending. O'Connor argued that if this feature were implemented, it would destroy the property of re-org safety during an "innocent" re-org, which would allow affected transactions to eventually get replayed as long as the re-org depth is less than 100. He suggested that the transaction should be required to be locktimed at least 100 blocks after the block referenced by the script feature, which would eliminate the impact on re-org safety and reduce mempool handling complexity. Luke Dashjr, who proposed the script feature, acknowledged the potential for non-innocent abuse but argued that it was no worse than double-spending. He also noted the importance of preventing over-eager usage and suggested that a consensus-enforced "maximum survivable reorg" be traced along with the outputs. Dashjr also believed that it was important to not allow overly short back references, as it would require worrying about short forks breaking propagation and more complex mempool handling. Dashjr had previously proposed the same script feature for another reason, which was to allow users to "vote against" long reorgs by ensuring their transactions couldn't be included in them. Although for that application, only 32 bits of the block hash would need to be used.</summary>
