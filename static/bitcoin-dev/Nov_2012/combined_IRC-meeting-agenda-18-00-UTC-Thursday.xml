    <summary>The core development team for Bitcoin has decided on Thursdays at 18:00 UTC as a good time to meet on the #bitcoin-dev freenode IRC channel to chat. The feature freeze for version 0.8 is discussed, and there are concerns regarding overselling it for miners and merchants when the ultraprune stuff is such a significant change. The bloom filtering work is preferred to be included in version 0.8 as an essential scalability/performance improvement for the network. There is some discussion about the BIP process, where some people believe that needing a process to allocate a number is over the top and that anyone can pick a number and add a BIP. However, there are concerns about the viability of proposed BIPs, and formal allocation should be done. Finally, it is agreed that Bloom filtering should make it into version 0.8, and ultraprune has some TODOs left, including auto-migration of old data and UTXO set consistency checks at startup.</summary>
