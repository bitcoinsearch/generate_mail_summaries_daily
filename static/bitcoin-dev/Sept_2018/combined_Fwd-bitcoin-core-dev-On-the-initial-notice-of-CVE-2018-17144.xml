    <summary>On September 22, 2018, Gregory Maxwell forwarded an email to the bitcoin-core-dev mailing list regarding a report of a zero-day exploit in Bitcoin ABC and Bitcoin Core. The report specified that duplicate inputs were not being checked in CheckBlock, which creates a problem when a transaction bypasses the mempool when it is included in a block, allowing for monetary inflation. The reporter sent the report to Pieter Wuille, deadalnix, Andrea Suisani, Gregory Maxwell, and Wladimir J. van der Laan. However, on Twitter, Andrea Suisani claimed that the report by awemany was a report of an inflation bug, contrary to the timeline published. Gregory Maxwell refuted this claim, stating that the report specifically stated that inflation was not possible because the node crashed. Additionally, awemany specifically said that "[the assert(is_spent)] seems to prevent the worse outcome of monetary inflation."In addition to the reported exploit, there were also code changes made to the Bitcoin Core software. These changes were submitted in a patch to the Bitcoin Core development mailing list by a user named Bryan. The changes include modifications to three different source files: tx_verify.cpp, net_processing.cpp, and validation.cpp.In tx_verify.cpp, there is an update that skips a slow duplicate input check. In net_processing.cpp, there are modifications to ProcessGetData and ProcessGetBlockData functions that alter how transactions are pushed and handled. Finally, in validation.cpp, there is a change to the UpdateCoins function that comments out an assert statement.</summary>
