    <summary>The recent bug fix for CVE-2018-17144 has created confusion over whether users should upgrade to Bitcoin Core 0.16.3 or backported patched versions. While the backported versions are still going through the gitian build process, all network participants are being urged to upgrade to 0.16.3 as soon as possible. The announcement posted on the Bitcoin Core site is considered adequately clear, but there is still some debate over whether everyone needs to upgrade immediately. While it is true that the bugfix can be backported to earlier versions, such as 0.14.3 and 0.15.2, there are other issues with those versions that make them less desirable overall. The best advice available is to upgrade to the latest version, even though this may not be feasible for all users.</summary>
