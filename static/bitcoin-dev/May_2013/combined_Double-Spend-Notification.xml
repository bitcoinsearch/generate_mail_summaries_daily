    <summary>In May 2013, Gavin Andresen expressed his support for double-spend propagation across the network. He asked if anyone was against it, assuming it did not allow arbitrary traffic multiplication, which he believed could be easily solved. The discussion continued with Robert Backhaus's suggestion that a decision had been made to make 0-conf double spends trivial so that no one would ever trust them. Pieter Wuille refuted this claim but acknowledged that there were arguments both for and against pure fee-based replacement. While fees are not a major motivator today compared to subsidy and overall network health, reducing the risk of double-spending can lower operating costs. However, people tend to underestimate the costs of unlikely risks, and more deterministic behavior can result in safer interactions. It is also important not to build a dependency on behavior that will not last. One point that was recently exposed is that replacement combined with child-pays-for-parent creates a new kind of double-spend defense. If someone double-spends a payment, you can instantly produce a child transaction that pays 100% of the double spend to fees, so the double spender cannot profit from it. However, a race to burn more money is strange, and even if the benefit of resisting double-spends is only short term, a short term benefit can greatly encourage Bitcoin adoption. Therefore, it is far from clear what should be done here, and there may evolve a community consensus regardless of what developers think about replace by fee.</summary>
