    <summary>In a conversation on May 15, 2013, Gavin suggested that the "guy fawkes" protocol Zooko was thinking about a year ago is similar to Adam's proposal. Adam's idea is to use a commitment to hide which coins are being spent, while in a guy fawkes signature, the commitment hides the preimage that proves someone had authority to spend a coin. By mixing blinded and unblinded inputs, priority and transaction fees can come from only the unblinded ones, which means that you could spend other coins along for the ride, and the network wouldn't know which ones were spent until it was too late to pretend it never saw them. However, there are weird economic implications to this, such as a blinded payment having a different utility level than an unblinded one. Mike Hearn suggested that Adamcoin sounds like ZeroCoin conceptually, but at great cost. Zerocoin conceals the connection from everyone forever, but Adamcoin, depending on how it's done, at most conceals transactions from people who aren't a party to them. An implementation would make identities public, but only after they're buried a bit. As an example, everyone creates txouts paying P2SH addresses with an OP_PUSH nonce in them and tells the recipient the nonce out of band. When recipients spend those coins, they provide the script but not the nonce, so the public doesn't know what coins are being spent. The out-of-band proofs that must be given to people when they spend coins would grow with the history of the coins, but this could go on forever without ambiguity over who owns what. To maintain privacy, the unblindings are published once transactions are sufficiently buried, bounding the growth of the proofs.</summary>
