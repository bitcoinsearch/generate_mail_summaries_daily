    <summary>The discussion between Peter Todd and Adam Back revolves around the vulnerabilities in Bitcoin's security. Todd suggests adding a new protocol message for non-repudiation instead of using SSL, which doesn't provide non-repudiation. He also talks about using Tor only for personal nodes and facing the issue of short onion peers. Back highlights network attacks that induce network splits as the primary vulnerability in Bitcoin and mentions the need for checkpoints to protect against such attacks. He also discusses the bootstrap problem with Tor and Bitcoin's higher assurance need for security. Todd argues that non-repudiation is crucial for trust generation, and its absence limits the ability to tie reputation to good behavior. He proposes the concept of per-node identity keypair to implement SSL transport. However, care is needed to avoid problems like deanonymizing use over tor with them. Finally, he emphasizes the importance of fraud proofs and their role in everything that the node might claim.</summary>
