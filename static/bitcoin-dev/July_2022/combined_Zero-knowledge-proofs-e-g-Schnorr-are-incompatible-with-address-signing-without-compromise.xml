    <summary>Pieter Wuille, a Bitcoin Core developer, recently responded to a message on the bitcoin-dev mailing list regarding Schnorr signatures' compatibility with address message signing. He explained that BIP340 intentionally chose not to support public key recovery and instead opted for batch verification.To make it compatible with the address signing mechanism, Pieter suggested including the public key and BIP340 signature in the encoded signature. Alternatively, he proposed creating a new message signing format specifically for Taproot, which he believes is redundant given the existence of BIP322.In another message, Pieter clarified that BIP340 does not support key recovery and reiterated that wallets supporting taproot signing already have code to produce BIP340 signatures.The algorithm for signing a message using the Schnorr signature scheme involves hashing auxiliary random data and xoring it with the private key to reduce the number of operations exposed to the actual secret key. The public key is included as input to prevent leakage of the secret key if the calculation of the public key is performed incorrectly or maliciously.However, the verification algorithm requires the public key to be retrieved from the signature to prove the authenticity of a Schnorr signature, making it incompatible with the zero-knowledge proof aspect of Schnorr.To make Schnorr signatures compatible with address message signing, the zero-knowledge part would have to be sacrificed or a separate message signing format just for Taproot would be required.In an excerpt from the BIP-notatether-messageverify thread, Pieter contemplates implementing address/message signing support for Taproot.</summary>
