    <summary>In a Bitcoin-dev thread, it was discussed whether covenants on bitcoin should be implemented with a soft fork or if the risk of losing coins to covenants and thus losing fungibility and freedom to transact is too much. Covenants are usually used to describe a concept that is counter to the point of Bitcoin as a monetary instrument, and the term has been applied for something that's different in key ways, which can be confusing. The present amount of security is about 1.7% of the total coin supply/year, and there is zero reason to stress about finding an "optimal" amount. An amount low enough to be easily affordable, but non-zero, is fine; 1% would be fine, 0.5% would probably be fine, and 0.1% would probably be fine. Pool operators are free to request larger fees from older utxos, or from all utxos, or from newer utxos, at their judgment, looking at the blockspace demand census and what other pool operators are doing. This is not consensus, it's policy, and it's solved above in the social layer.</summary>
