    <summary>The Bitcoin community is currently discussing the activation of Taproot, a proposed soft fork upgrade to the Bitcoin protocol. The main point of contention is whether to activate Taproot with or without the "lockinontimeout" (LOT) parameter, which would allow users to veto the upgrade if necessary. There are arguments for both LOT=true and LOT=false options, but there is no overwhelming consensus.During a meeting held on February 16th, consensus was reached on everything except LockinOnTimeout. The proposed activation height range is 693504-745920 with a MASF threshold of 1815/2016 blocks (90%). However, only about 100 people attended the meeting, and some mining pools expressed a preference for LOT=false.Leading up to the meetings, there were concerns about the risk of chain splits and falling out of consensus if different implementations ship with different consensus rules. Despite this, some argue that it's better to not activate anything at all than risk a network split down the middle. There have been several proposals put forward to address these concerns, including a suggestion from ZmnSCPxj to release a version of Bitcoin Core that requires users to choose between activating Taproot with or without LOT. Matt Hill proposed the inclusion of a LOT=true option to Bitcoin Core that carries a default of LOT=false, allowing miners and users to activate Taproot without the consent of the other.Ultimately, the activation mechanism for Taproot must be carefully considered to minimize the risk of a reorganization of several blocks, which has happened in the past during other soft fork upgrades. While taproot is a model of how a soft-fork should be designed, this doesn't imply anything about the consensus code which represents the activation thereof. Hence all the debate around activation - ultimately its also defining a fork, and given the politics around it, one which almost certainly carries significantly more risk than Taproot.Despite majority support for LOT=false in the first meeting, arguments had not been explored in-depth, and the follow-up meeting focused on whether LOT should be true or false. The activation mechanism for Taproot is still under discussion, and more review of LOT=true code is needed, along with support for features from the bip148 client. It is suggested that a UASF-style command line option to allow consensus rule changes in the node in the short term carries some risk of a fork.The Bitcoin community must prepare for bad or worst-case scenarios in advance and avoid arriving at the darkest timeline. While mining pools have pledged support for Taproot, secure systems cannot be built based solely on pledges of support. Discussions are healthy, and we should strive to build secure systems that do not depend on pledges of support from mining pools or any other human actors.</summary>
