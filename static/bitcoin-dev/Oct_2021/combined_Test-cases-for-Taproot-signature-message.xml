    <summary>On September 16, 2021, Giacomo Caironi wrote to the bitcoin-dev list, noting that there was better documentation for Segwit signature messages than Taproot. He suggested creating a separate BIP for Taproot signature messages, as is done for Segwit. Pieter Wuille responded, explaining that while there is no separate BIP for Taproot signature messages, the message function is different for BIP 341 and BIP 342, making it difficult to cleanly separate them. Wuille did agree that the test vectors for Taproot are not very helpful for debugging, but said he was not inclined to support creating a separate BIP at this point.Caironi also noted that the test vectors for Taproot have no documentation and do not target specific parts of the code. Wuille agreed and suggested that test vectors aimed at helping developers debug issues could be useful. Caironi offered to write such test cases for Taproot. The related pull request is now open on GitHub.</summary>
