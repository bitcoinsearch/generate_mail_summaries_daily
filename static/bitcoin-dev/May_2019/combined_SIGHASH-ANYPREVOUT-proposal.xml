    <summary>In this email, ajtowns shared a BIP draft that enables SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT and SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUTANYSCRIPT on top of taproot/tapscript. The author expressed caution about the implementation of ANYPREVOUT signature due to several issues that came up during its development. In contrast, taproot has a roughed-out security proof for over a year now. The draft includes an additional regular signature to accompany every ANYPREVOUT signature to limit possible negative impacts. The theory assumes that the private key for that signature is maintained similarly to current transactions, but it may not survive adversarial reality. ajtowns shared some interesting features of the BIP draft, such as upgrading tapscript's existing CHECKSIG, demonstrating how to use the taproot internal key as the public key for CHECKSIG operations in script, and having two variants, ANYPREVOUT and ANYPREVOUTANYSCRIPT, which seems helpful for eltoo. The author discussed the safety of funds in Bitcoin and suggested that funds are safe in Bitcoin if they're held in a cryptographically secured UTXO under enough proof of work that a reorg is unlikely. The author believes that as long as personal use of ANYPREVOUT is only to sign transactions that pay the money back to oneself, the funds will remain safe. Making ANYPREVOUT only available via script is aligned with this notion. However, the author acknowledged that there may be other ways in which ANYPREVOUT is scary that could be formalized and addressed. Finally, ajtowns added that ANYPREVOUT may not be compatible with luke's "malleability proof" wallet idea.</summary>
