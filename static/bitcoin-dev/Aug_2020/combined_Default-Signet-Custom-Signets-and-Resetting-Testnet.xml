    <summary>The Bitcoin Core team is currently developing Signet, a new testing network for developers. The first Signet PR in Bitcoin Core is currently under review. However, there are still questions remaining about whether there should be a single "default" Signet or multiple custom Signets. Additionally, concerns have been raised about how many people should have keys to sign each new block.Michael Folkson suggests that having a default Signet would be useful, especially as a staging ground for testing proposed soft forks. At present, Kalle Alm and AJ Towns hold the keys for Signet. It was suggested that at least one additional key holder in the EU/US timezone be added to ensure blocks can continue to be mined during an Asia-Pacific outage.Some members of the community have expressed concerns that Signet will replace testnet. However, Folkson assures them that testnet will continue as long as someone out there is mining testnet blocks. There is also a question about whether testnet needs to be reset, which is still up for debate. Assuming Signet is successful, there will be less testing on testnet, but what testing use cases will still prefer testnet?To ensure everyone's testing needs are being considered, the Bitcoin Core team welcomes feedback and questions on Signet. Folkson acknowledges the challenges of enabling soft forks on Signet and then updating them. He believes that having a default Signet with a network effect would prevent the splintering of Signet networks with different combinations of proposed soft forks enabled. Kalle believes that Signet should run indefinitely unless specific problems arise.Finally, the Bitcoin Core team encourages additional code review and testing of the first Signet PR. They seek to ensure that everyone's testing needs are being considered and recommend discussing matters unrelated to the repo on the mailing list or on IRC.</summary>
