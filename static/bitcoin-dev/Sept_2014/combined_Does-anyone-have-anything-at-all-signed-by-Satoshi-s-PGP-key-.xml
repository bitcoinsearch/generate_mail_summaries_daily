    <summary>In a discussion on the Bitcoin-development mailing list in September 2014, the value of in-person vetting of identity was debated. Jeff Garzik argued that the online entity known as Satoshi is the relevant fingerprint and could easily be established without any in-person meetings, while Brian Hoffman argued that the value of in-person vetting of identity is undeniable and asked whether it's possible to receive any kind of governmental clearance or credential without in-person vetting. In response, Matt Whitlock said that attaching a Bitcoin public key to an email signature without signing messages would not work, as the email server could replace the public key with another one, rendering the later-provided signature invalid. Whitlock suggested that the Web of Trust (WoT) is a reasonable way to establish trust about the link between an online identity and a real-world identity, but in the case of a developer with an existing reputation for his online identity, that link is irrelevant.</summary>
