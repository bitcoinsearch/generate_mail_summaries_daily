    <summary>The conversation between Chris Priest and Vincent Truong via bitcoin-dev mailing list on December 13, 2015, discussed the concept of archive nodes. Priest stated that not every node is an archive node, and lowering the resource requirements to independently enforce the rules of the system is virtuous. Truong suggested that some users could lose their UTXOs if miners discarded them, but this was later clarified by Priest that jl2012's post did not cause the outputs to become discarded. The proposal focuses on adding hash tree fragments to paper wallets to show membership, which means that a user would have to contact an archive node to get the UTXO data to make the transaction. However, Priest argued that this proposal does not solve the core problem as someone can still flood the network with lots of UTXOs as long as they spend them quickly. On the other hand, Truong believed that keeping historical data is cheaper than bandwidth and storage, which is usually the cheaper resource. Peter Todd had proposed something similar with "STXO commitments," but the primary argument against this approach was that the membership proofs became extensive. Overall, the discussion concluded that it was better to be conservative with the send button and to avoid reflexive opposition by people who don't understand the concept.</summary>
