    <summary>This BIP proposal suggests a communication channel that allows the authors of blocks to signal whether they have validated the whole chain up to and including the content of their block. Correct use of this signaling is not enforced internally to the network but if used it can act as a hint allowing more intelligent risk analysis. Non-verifying clients of the network may check this bit and use it as an input to their risk modeling. The set state for the bit is defined as verified so that un(der)maintained systems do not falsely signal validation. This flag is intended to mitigate the harm of breaking the thin client assumption by allowing miners to efficiently provide additional information on their level of validation. This will allow the network to take advantage of the benefits of bypassed validation with minimal collateral damage. The accuracy of this field must not be strongly relied upon because some miners could falsely set the flag either intentionally or unintentionally due to misunderstandings, misconfigurations, laziness, or other human factors. Processing and propagation delays resulting from increased transaction load contribute to block orphaning when multiple blocks are found at close to the same time. This has caused some miners to work on extending the chain with the most proof-of-work prior to validating the latest block(s). Although this validation skipping undermines the security assumptions of thin clients, it also has a beneficial effect: these delays also make the mining process unfair and cause increased rewards for the largest miners relative to other miners, resulting in a centralization pressure. Deferring validation can reduce this pressure and improve the security of the Bitcoin system long term.The user community should keep in mind that both setting the flag correctly and mining without verification (for brief periods of time) are healthy for the network. If participants are punished for following this specification, they will simply lie, and its utility will be diminished. There is no special deployment strategy required for this proposed mechanism.</summary>
