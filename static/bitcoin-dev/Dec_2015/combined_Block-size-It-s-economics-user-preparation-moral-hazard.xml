    <summary>Pieter Wuille, a Bitcoin Core developer, has explained the role of Bitcoin Core maintainers in deciding whether a hard fork is necessary and safe. According to him, it is not necessary to have a hashpower vote to decide whether a hard fork should be accepted. Instead, it is important to ensure that full nodes accept and adopt it in time. A hashpower vote can be used to ensure that miners agree. Pieter believes that the threshold for a hardfork has not been reached yet, especially since scaling can be achieved in the short term using soft forks.In response to Jeff Garzik's email regarding the block size limit and economic change event (ECE) risk, Pieter argued that increasing the block size limit in response to fear of ECE is the wrong approach. He believes that economic change is inevitable. Pieter further explained that Segregated Witness (SW) only mitigates contention at some level after several months, assuming conditions go as planned. He suggested that both SW and a short-term bump increase capacity available per price, and they are completely orthogonal. However, he disagreed with the motivation behind a capacity increase hard fork, stating that it is easier and safer to roll out softfork SW.Pieter stated that the core dev team should communicate better that deciding consensus rules is not within their power. They can only merge any uncontroversial consensus change proposal. He finds it immoral and dangerous to merge a hard fork without extremely widespread agreement. On the other hand, he has proposed an approach that includes Segregated Witness as a first step, which solves/issues half a dozen other issues at the same time and does not require the degree of certainty needed for a hardfork. Lastly, Pieter mentioned that hard forks require much clearer consensus and longer roll-out timeframes to be safe.</summary>
