    <summary>The Scaling Bitcoin Workshop in Hong Kong recently presented proposals for increasing the capacity of the Bitcoin system. The development of the Bitcoin system should be guided by principles including decentralization, minimization of trust costs, and addressing the root problem with conventional currency. However, there are trade-offs between scale and decentralization due to the cost of validation and access to the chain for dispute resolution. Fortunately, there is great technology in the works that makes navigating the trade-offs easier.One proposal presented at the workshop was Segregated Witness (SegWit), which increases Bitcoin's scalability and capacity by taking signatures outside the scope of the current blocksize limit. This proposal gives a 2x capacity increase (more if multisig is widely used) and makes additional capacity-and future capacity beyond it-safer by increasing efficiency and allowing more trade-offs. There is a working implementation of Segregated Witness proposed by Pieter Wuille.Other proposals called "weak blocks", "thin blocks" or "soft blocks" build on top of efficient relay techniques and move virtually all the transmission time of a block before the block is found, eliminating size from the orphan race calculation. Non-bandwidth scaling mechanisms like transaction cut-through and bidirectional payment channels are also being developed.The discussion revolves around the 'soft-fork segwit' proposal that can help in resolving deadlock on scalability issue. It can provide a short-term capacity boost, solve various unrelated problems like malleability, fraud proofs and script extensibility while reducing bandwidth/storage and indirectly improving the effectiveness of systems like Lightning.The conversation is between several individuals on the topic of Segregated Witness (SegWit) and its implications. Gavin Andresen suggests that stuffing the SegWit merkle tree in the coinbase transaction is messy and will complicate consensus-critical code. Several soft-fork compatible options are available, and the exact location is not that critical. There are several concerns regarding the implementation of SegWit, including its effect on witness safety factor in the case of strategic or malicious behavior by miners. However, proponents believe that it is a pragmatic approach that trusts that we'll respond to whatever contingencies surprise us on the road to success.Overall, there are various proposals being discussed and developed for improving the capacity and scalability of the Bitcoin system while maintaining decentralization and minimizing trust costs. The focus is on non-bandwidth-increase-based scaling, while building additional tools that would make bandwidth increases safer long term.</summary>
