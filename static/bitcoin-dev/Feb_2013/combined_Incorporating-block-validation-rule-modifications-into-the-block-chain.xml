    <summary>The conversation revolves around the block size limit of Bitcoin and its effects on the system's security and decentralization. Stephen Pair argues that miners have a strong incentive to distribute blocks rapidly and widely, but Gregory Maxwell points out that this does not consider the externalized costs of the other nodes required to validate the blocks. He also raises concerns about selfish miners and the capacity to run validating nodes becoming a barrier to entry.Gavin Andresen disagrees with Maxwell, arguing that block size limits are not necessary for security and decentralization, and says he will write up his reasons why. Pair suggests that validation and propagation costs should be used to impose scarcity rather than block sizes, but Maxwell questions who bears the cost and how this aligns with Bitcoin's goal of being trustless. The conversation ends with speculation about a future where block sizes may need to increase and the risk of controversy if there is a lack of agreement on parameters.Bitcoin is a purely autonomous monetary system based entirely on math, which solves the problem of double spending by using hashcash to vote. However, this requires that everyone can see the results of the vote, assuming that the majority of hash power isn't a dishonest party and that honest nodes can't be prevented from hearing the honest history.With non-uniform block forwarding, communicating blocks becomes costly enough that it will only be sustained if entities jealously guard and charge for access/forwarding. This would handicap the Bitcoin consensus algorithm and make it difficult for participants to know that the history they have won't get replaced by a more authoritative one. If nodes start charging fees to collect and distribute transactions and blocks, it radically undermines Bitcoin.Large miners would locate and connect to each other, making it rational for many to let someone else take on the validation cost, leading to a small number of vested parties doing all the validation. For a great many to perform validation, keeping the system honest and decentralized as it was envisioned, requires that the cost be almost unnoticeable, a tiny fraction of what some industrial player could easily handle. If the cost goes up, some people cross their boundary and lose their voice, which may lead to externalization of the cost of keeping Bitcoin secure by not participating.The trustworthiness of Bitcoin's monetary system is questionable, leading some to suggest using government-issued currencies instead. Bitcoin's anti-spam policies are failing due to parties using inefficient transaction patterns, creating externalized costs for future users. There have been no reparametrizations that seem likely to achieve the desired incentive alignment in the near term.Bitcoin cannot meet its security and decentralization promises without blockspace scarcity to drive non-trivial fees and without scaling limits to keep it decentralized. Changing the max block size would only be done if it becomes necessary. Bitcoin is not a democracy and consensus is used only for the ordering of transactions, which protects users from popular whim. Mining is not a particularly just way of voting, as it is controlled by a half dozen people with limited authority.Arbitrary rule changes would vastly increase their power, and there are engineering challenges associated with implementing complex rule languages. In summary, such proposals are technically interesting but would not be obviously compatible with the economic motivations that make Bitcoin secure or morally compatible with the social contract embedded in the system today.</summary>
