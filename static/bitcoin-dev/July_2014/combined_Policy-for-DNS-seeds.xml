    <summary>The Bitcoin Core team established a few basic rules for the DNS seeds. Bitcoin Core attempts to minimize the level of trust in DNS seeds, but DNS seeds still pose a small amount of risk for the network. Other implementations of Bitcoin software may also use the same seeds and may be more exposed. In light of this exposure, this document establishes some basic expectations for the operation of dnsseeds. A DNSseed operating organization or person is expected to follow good host security practices and maintain control of their serving infrastructure and not sell or transfer control of their infrastructure. The DNSseed results must consist exclusively of fairly selected and functioning Bitcoin nodes from the public network to the best of the operators understanding and capability. For the avoidance of doubt, the results may be randomized but must not single-out any group of hosts to receive different results unless due to an urgent technical necessity and disclosed. Additionally, the results may not be served with a DNS TTL of less than one minute. Any logging of DNS queries should be only that which is necessary for the operation of the service or urgent health of the Bitcoin network and must not be retained longer than necessary or disclosed to any third party. Information gathered as a result of the operators node-spidering (not from DNS queries) may be freely published or retained, but only if this data was not made more complete by biasing node connectivity (a violation of expectation (1)). Operators are encouraged, but not required, to publicly document the details of their operating practices. A reachable email contact address must be published for inquiries related to the DNSseed operation. If these expectations cannot be satisfied the operator should discontinue providing services and contact the active Bitcoin Core development team as well as posting on bitcoin-development.Peter Todd suggested writing an "Expectations for DNSSeed users" outlining what security properties the seeds actually have, and what kind of attacks are possible. He saw some amount of use of DNS seeds which he would consider inadvisable considering their weakness. He also suggested that many users would be better served with seeds that offer authenticated and encrypted connections to the seeds, especially if they're using authed/encrypted connections to nodes, e.g. Tor hidden services. Christian Decker suggested research projects into node distribution. Specifically, he wondered whether the collection and analysis of DNS query origin is allowed when queries are anonymized and aggregated. This would prevent the identification of a single user, which he assumed was the rationale for point 4. Wladimir established these rules for the DNS seeds as used in the Bitcoin Core software.</summary>
