    <summary>A potential network exploit was discussed on July 27, 2014, regarding a node that came online and was processing the most traffic out of any tor node. The node has only port 8333 open, is expensive to run, and has been up for three days doing mostly plaintext Bitcoin traffic. However, without the exit flag, no normal tor node should be selecting it as an exit. The bitnodes crawler showed it accepting inbound bitcoin connections 2-3 weeks ago but doesn't now. It fits a pattern of someone running a Bitcoin node widely connecting to everyone it can on IPv4 to try to deanonymize people and also running a tor exit (and locally intercepting 8333 there). It appears that this node is lying about what software it's running. The bitcoin protocol is identityless, and "number of sockets" is as close as one gets to identifying nodes. The behavior of the node could not be considered abuse, as it follows the rules and may even improve the transaction and block propagation. It isn't relaying transactions or blocks as far as anyone with a connection to it can tell. People have been running spy nodes for a long time. Last discussion on the measures for anti-global-resource-consumption was at https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=310323.0, but it hasn't seemed to be a huge issue such that adding more protocol surface area was justified. There was a call for better incoming connection limiting, and gmaxwell had a good scheme with interactive proof-of-memory, but where's the latest writeup? Several others observed the node, which appeared to be doing nothing but listening without sending transactions, indicating surveillance. The weird tor non-exit-flagged-exit adds a fun level of intrigue to it.</summary>
