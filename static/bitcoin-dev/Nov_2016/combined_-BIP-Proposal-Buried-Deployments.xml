    <summary>Bitcoin Core has recently merged a simplification to the consensus rules surrounding deployment of BIPs 34, 66 and 65, which is considered worth documenting in a BIP for posterity. This change will replace the trigger mechanism by caching the block heights at which those consensus rules became enforced, which is now possible since the chain has long passed the blocks at which those consensus rules have triggered. The full draft can be found at https://github.com/sdaftuar/bips/blob/buried-deployments/bip-buried-deployments.mediawiki. Pieter Wuille recommends users validate the full chain without checkpoints and from that chain select their own checkpoints and place them into config in order to get rid of checkpoints. The buried softfork proposal is not considered as a security feature but rather as a change that modifies the validity of a theoretically construable chain from invalid to valid. Eric Voskuil disagrees with the precedent set by hardcoding rule changes based on the assumption that large forks indicate a catastrophic failure.</summary>
