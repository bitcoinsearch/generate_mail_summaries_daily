    <summary>A team led by Nicholas Gregory and Ray Youssef is developing a peer-to-peer market system that aims to enable global trading, which is censorship-resistant and permissionless. The proposed system design combines the Nostr architecture with Lightning onion routing infrastructure to provide a high level of privacy for market participants. Trades are escrowed under Bitcoin Script contracts, relying on moderations and know your peer oracles for adjudication. The design proposes a Web-of-Stakes to enable scoring of trades, counterparties, and services operators.The proposed system is designed to serve on-ramp/off-ramp trading while being extendable to support any kind of trading, including goods, services, and bitcoin financial derivatives. Feedback on the proposed system is welcome, and the researchers plan to release code and modules according to the best Bitcoin open-source and decentralized standards established by Bitcoin Core. Collaboration with everyone in the community to standardize libraries and guarantee interoperability between clients is planned with long-term thinking in mind.However, the email thread discusses the concept of front-running in peer-to-peer marketplaces, where bulletin board operators may enter a trade with advance knowledge of a block transaction that will influence the price of the underlying security to capitalize on the trade. The design aims to mitigate this risk through security paradigms such as duplicating the announcement of offers to multiple concurrent boards and monitoring the latency for anomalies or running the bulletin boards as a federation under Honey Badger BFT.To address the front-running issue, the Civkit proposes a flexible framework for peer-to-peer marketplaces, where propagation latency monitoring and federation set and rules can be adjusted as "front-running resistance" parameters, adapting to the types of trades and market participants' tolerance. The whitepaper delves into the system's architecture, and the code and modules will be released according to the best Bitcoin open-source and decentralized standards established by Bitcoin Core. Collaboration with everyone in the community to standardize libraries and guarantee interoperability between clients is planned with long-term thinking in mind.
