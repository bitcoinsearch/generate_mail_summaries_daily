    <summary>In a Bitcoin-dev email, one user proposed that the legal definition of "covenant" would classify things like CSV and CLTV as covenants. However, another user argued that in the context of Bitcoin, the most useful definition is when the scriptPubKey of a utxo restricts the scriptPubKey in the output(s) of a transaction spending that utxo. They noted that CTV, TLUV, etc, do that, while CSV and CLTV do not. The first user also reviewed BIP 119 and discussed its limitations. They stated that the use case for congestion-controlled transactions has not been fully thought through yet, and that they would like to see at least one of the described non-consensus standardizations fully implemented before moving toward activation. The email also touched on payment channels, which the second user suggested should be created with the spending transaction instead of merely being batched. Another topic discussed was CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY, which makes it easier to set up trustless CoinJoins. However, the first user did not see how this made any difference, given participants still had to agree on outputs in advance. The email noted that deployment of CTV could be done via BIP 9 VersionBits deployed through Speedy Trial, but the second user rejected this, stating that it represented developers trying to impose their will over community consensus. Finally, the email discussed some technical issues around CTV, such as it being incompatible with P2SH and severely restricted to simple templates. It also mentioned an exchange's hot wallet using an address that could automatically move to a cold storage address after a relative timeout, as well as noting that OP_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY would not make scripts valid for policy until the new rule is active.</summary>
