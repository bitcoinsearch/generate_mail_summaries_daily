    <summary>Bitcoin Core developer Anthony Towns has proposed two potential approaches for activating soft forks in the future. The first approach involves an update to BIP 8 by Luke, which uses signaling via a version bit and state transitions based on height instead of median time. It also includes an optional mandatory activation at the end of the year and mandatory signaling if it occurs. The second approach is based on a slower method proposed by Matt, which gradually decreases the threshold during the secondary period until it reaches 50% and then mandatorily activates. Both approaches have their advantages and disadvantages, with the BIP 8 method having a shorter timeframe for upgrades and the "decreasing threshold" approach providing a longer timeline.Towns suggests using BIP 8 with mandatory activation disabled in Bitcoin Core and updating the parameters if there are no reasonable objections after nine months. Additionally, he proposes changing the dec-threshold proposal to be compatible with BIP 8 and supporting miners coordinating via BIP 91 to bring activation forward or de-risk mandatory activation.Towns stresses the importance of having contingency plans in case things do not go smoothly, as well as ensuring that the underlying soft fork makes sense and is well-implemented on its own merits. He also highlights the need to discuss the changes with as many people as possible and address any reasonable objections. Lastly, he expresses disappointment with the naive flag day fork activation being discussed in the form of BIP 9, stating that how Taproot activates will set a community understanding and future norms around how many changes are made. Overall, Towns believes that starting with something simple and being ready to adapt if necessary is the best approach for activating soft forks in the future.</summary>
