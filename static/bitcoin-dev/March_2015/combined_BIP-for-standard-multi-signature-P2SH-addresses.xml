    <summary>In a discussion on March 11th, 2015, Pindar Wong suggested the idea of introducing a 'Bitcoin-Draft' (BD) status with an auto-expiry period. He mentioned that the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) has a similar concept called 'Internet Drafts' (ID). Thomas Kerin then requested a BIP number for their proposal, but there have been issues in the past with people squatting on numbers and demanding access to the same ones. Therefore, as a matter of procedure, squatted numbers will not be assigned, and proposals should not be referred to as "BIP[nn]" until they are actually a BIP. Instead, placeholder names can be used for drafting. It was also noted that many proposals are withdrawn after further discussion shows a lack of public interest or other functionality. If there is any confusion about the process, it is recommended to seek out public documentation on the matter.</summary>
