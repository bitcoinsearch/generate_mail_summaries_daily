    <summary>Amir Taaki, a Bitcoin developer, tried offering bounties worth $4,000 for bug fixing in Bitcoin but got very few responses. He concluded that the only way to encourage bug-fixing is to pay people full-time to work on Bitcoin under an organization. In response to Joel Joonatan Kaartinen's suggestion of adding a way for anyone to add to the bounty attached to a bug and creating a listing page for bugs with their bounties, John Smith stated that the biggest problem would be organizational in getting BTC together for bounties. He suggested that publishing a roadmap might help by planning a few "bug fix only" releases before scheduling addition of new features. Smith also added that a high profile member such as Gavin would have enough trust to ask for support.</summary>
