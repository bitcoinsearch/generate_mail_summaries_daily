    <summary>There are backward-compatibility issues with Wallet encryption in Bitcoin. Version 0.3.23 dies after writing one unencrypted private key to an otherwise encrypted wallet, and version 0.3.22 shows only a total balance of what is held only in unencrypted keys. Suggestions have been made to work around the issue, including renaming wallet.dat for encrypted wallets or doing nothing and letting old clients get mad. The preferred solution is to use either https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/378 or https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/381 to prevent this issue in future versions of Bitcoin. However, there are concerns about breaking backup scripts and potential errors on Windows. A solution for future-proofing involves adding a nMinVersion that specifies "you must be at least THIS version to read this file." In July 2011, Bitcoin developers discuss the idea of intentionally breaking unsafe or badly designed backup mechanisms in the context of an upcoming merger between import/export features. Gavin Andresen suggests truncating the wallet.dat file and setting its file-permissions to 000 upon encryption to break old versions of Bitcoin and dumb wallet backup scripts. Meanwhile, Matt Corallo finds a data structure in wallet settings that should cause all versions since Bitcoin was on Github to crash on load, thus resolving all known issues and suggestions on newenc. The developers also discuss future-proofing wallet.dat by adding a nMinVersion that specifies "you must be at least THIS version to read this file." They agree that this would give users a reasonable message if they try to downgrade after an incompatible change.The priority is to get 0.3.24 out as soon as possible to have lead time on 0.4.</summary>
