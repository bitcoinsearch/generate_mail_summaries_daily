    <summary>Bitcoin version 0.3.24 is now available for download on SourceForge. This release includes fixes for block download problems and crashes caused by loss of network connection. DNS seeding and UPNP are enabled by default in the GUI client, while the percentage of Bitcoin clients that accept incoming connections is quite small, which is a problem. The release also features initial unit testing framework, and internal wallet code cleanup is included which provides the basis for v0.4's wallet encryption. Wallet encryption is ready for testing at GitHub. The CWallet class has received multiple bug fixes, including a fix for a segfault when creating a new wallet, limiting the response to getblocks to half the output buffer size, and fixing synchronization of default key. There was also an issue with missing includes needed for Boost 1.46, which has now been fixed. AddressBook synchronization between a CWallet and CWalletDB has also been addressed. Additionally, a GetTotalBlocksEstimate() function has been added, and a magic number has been moved to a constant.Other changes in v0.3.24 include DNS seeding enabled by default, UPNP enabled in the GUI client, an initial unit testing framework, and internal wallet code cleanup. Wallet encryption has also been developed but is not included in this release. This version is available for Mac OS X, Windows, and Linux operating systems. However, wallet encryption, which was expected to be ready for release, will not be included in this version and will be tested separately before it is included in the next release, v0.4. The notable changes in v0.3.24 include DNS seeding enabled by default and UPNP enabled by default in the GUI client. The percentage of Bitcoin clients that accept incoming connections is quite small, which is concerning. Therefore, this change should help improve this issue. The release of bitcoin-0.3.24 has been announced, which includes several bug fixes and updates. Jeff Garzik, the co-founder of Bloq and former Bitcoin Core developer, suggests using the alert function if there haven't been many upgrades in a few days. The Mac OSX version of the bitcoin client has finally been posted at https://sourceforge.net/projects/bitcoin/files/Bitcoin/bitcoin-0.3.24/, and updated sums have been provided. The full changelog is available on GitHub.</summary>
