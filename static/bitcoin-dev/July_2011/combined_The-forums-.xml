    <summary>A user named John Smith expressed annoyance towards bitcoin.org forums and requested to remove the link from the website and replace it with a forum that solely helps users, merchants, and developers. He proposed a neutral place for people to adopt the technology similar to Ubuntu forums. The discussions on the forums included illegal activities that gave Bitcoin a bad reputation. Another user, Robert McKay, suggested that the development project should move to a new URL. However, Matt pointed out that the problem is not the forums but the fact that they are giving Bitcoin a bad name by discussing illegal activities. It is suggested that the forums be marked as unofficial and not part of Bitcoin proper.</summary>
