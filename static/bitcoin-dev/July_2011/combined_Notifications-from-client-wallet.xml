    <summary>A proposal has been made to add notifications to the client and wallet so that UIs no longer have to poll for changes. The boost::signal mechanism is proposed which allows decoupled delivery of signals from an object, so multiple other objects can listen in on an event without the emitting object having to care. Specific notifications were then discussed for the wallet and network client. For the wallet, there could be balanceChanged (maybe even per-account), transactionAdded, transactionUpdated (which may include more confirmations), transactionRemoved (for completeness), addressAdded, addressUpdated, addressRemoved and notification. There could also be int askFee for asking user for fee. For the network client, there could be numConnectionsChanged, numBlocksChanged, and notification.</summary>
