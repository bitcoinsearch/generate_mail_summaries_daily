    <summary>The user encountered a problem with their UI after syncing to the latest git version. The issue was identified in script.cpp, specifically in a piece of code that would only return "true" on keys that are in the keystore (private keys). The missing addresses were also noted in the detailed transaction view. The user found a solution by commenting out the problematic line of code, but expressed concern about any potential impacts this may have elsewhere. A screenshot detailing the issue is also included in the context.</summary>
