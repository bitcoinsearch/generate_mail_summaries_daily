    <summary>In December 2012, Mark Friedenbach and Alan Reiner discussed the risks and benefits of promoting simplified payment verification (SPV) nodes to new Bitcoin users. Friedenbach argued against incentivizing SPV nodes as it could lead to centralization issues, and there were still unresolved issues regarding data structure that required consensus-building, implementation efforts, and performance testing for consensus. Meanwhile, Reiner believed that SPV nodes did not pose significant risks of centralization, and the current user experience was poor, potentially leading to a loss of interest in Bitcoin. He also suggested that SPV nodes were better than nothing for new users.Friedenbach warned about the risk of sybil attacks from attackers who could partition large miners, but he believed that this concern could be addressed by a healthy darknet of private authenticated peerings between miners and other likely targets. Both parties agreed that starting with reduced security and gradually moving towards full validation was a good idea. The discussion highlighted the importance of promoting Bitcoin usage without compromising its decentralization and security. It discouraged promoting less capable and secure software to users, which endangers the network's robustness. The focus should be on creating user-friendly software that accommodates both maximal decentralization and ease of use. Encouraging new users to start using Bitcoin, even if they don't support it, is acknowledged, and making all the software painless for users is a shared goal. While the argument that we don't need every man and his dog to run a full node was made, the fact that as many people as possible should run one to maintain the system's security was countered. The success of Tor, which is a distributed but controlled system with a weaker trust model than that of Bitcoin, was explained. The missed fad window of Bitcoin and the need for more resources to make improvements were also discussed.The value of Bitcoin comes from the soundness of its properties and the persistence of its security, which depends on the integrity of the distributed ledger. If the ledger is disrupted, the damage produced can be irreversible. In contrast, Tor's value depends on its current usefulness, not past or future security. It was argued that if the community leads with client software that is not a full-capable node, then Bitcoin will fail, or at least fail to be anything but the world's most inefficient centralized payment system. Therefore, it is suggested that by improving the new user experience without compromising the system, we can justify more support of work that improves it. There is no set timeline for the adoption of Bitcoin, and there are many practical reasons why slow adoption is beneficial, including reducing the harm users experience from growing pains. By allowing things to mature at their own pace, we can preserve the principles that make the system valuable.</summary>
