    <summary>In this context, Mike Koss proposed an alternative to the BIP 32 proposal for a deterministic wallet which is based on a hierarchical string representation instead of integers. However, Pieter pointed out that blindly iterating through strings is not realistically possible, leading to the loss of backup recoverability property. This defeats the purpose of a deterministic wallet as reliable backups of both the original ultimate root and the string are required to establish new string names. If the backup of strings is incomplete in Mike's scheme, some or all assigned coin may be lost forever. Moreover, the extended hierarchy of multipliers in Mike's proposal makes Watson Ladd uncomfortable. Ladd also suggested that the easiest deterministic wallet construction is to use a stream cipher to generate random bytes used as private keys. However, this construction has no ability to separate address generation from spending, which is essential for merchant applications and limited privacy properties of the Bitcoin system.</summary>
