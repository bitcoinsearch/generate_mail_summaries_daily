    <summary>In a recent discussion on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, the need to revisit the goals and activation methods for soft forks was discussed. The basic requirements include avoiding activating in the face of reasonable objection, activating within a timeframe which makes high node-level adoption likely, not losing hashpower to un-upgraded miners, using hashpower enforcement to de-risk the upgrade process, and following the will of the community without overruling any reasonable objection.BIP 9 is proposed as an effective method that checks most of the boxes, but there are concerns about unreasonable objections (#5) and issues with BIP 8. A standard BIP 9 deployment with a one-year time horizon for activation with 95% miner readiness is suggested, with a six-month quieting period in case of no activation, and a command-line parameter enabling users to opt into a BIP 8 deployment with a 24-month time-horizon for flag-day activation. This provides a long time horizon for standard activation while still ensuring all goals are met.Luke Dashjr called out some mistakes in the implementation of SegWit activation and proposed resuming work on revising BIP 8 with a mandatory signal. He believes that BIP 9 is a proven failure and flag day soft forks have their own issues. The proposal was to ensure everyone has upgraded their node software and then activate through a flag day soft fork. To avoid creating an ambiguous quantum state, old miners could resume mining unchanged after the mandatory signal period.Matt Corallo, a Bitcoin Core developer, proposed an activation method for consensus changes in Bitcoin. The proposal aims to ensure that the Bitcoin network stays in consensus and focuses on catching errors before the live network upgrade. Corallo's model comprises three main strategies: 1) a standard BIP 9 deployment with a one-year time horizon for activation with 95% miner readiness, 2) a six-month quieting period during which the community can analyze and discuss the reasons for no activation, and 3) a simple command-line/bitcoin.conf parameter that enables users to opt into a BIP 8 deployment with a 24-month time-horizon for flag-day activation.In a Bitcoin developer email thread, the discussion about BIP8-like activation and node warnings has emerged. A consensus rule is suggested that would require blocks to signal for activation in the last activation window. However, it's not necessary, according to some developers. Outdated nodes can implement warnings and see them even if they are activated in the last activation window.The overall consensus is that a long lead time is needed to ensure everyone upgrades their nodes and that there needs to be more time for observation and discussion before a BIP 8/flag day activation. The focus should be on catching errors well before the last minute and moving away from consensus decisions being a "who has the most money/power/hashpower/nodes/reddit-accounts" contest to being a question of "have we dealt with every reasonable technical objection?"</summary>
