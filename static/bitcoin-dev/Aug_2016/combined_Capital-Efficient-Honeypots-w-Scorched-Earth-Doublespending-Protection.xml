    <summary>In a bitcoin-dev thread, Chris Priest raised concerns over insider attacks. He questioned how the system could prevent such attacks and how it can differentiate between an outsider or an insider who compromises server #4. Christian Decker explained that if someone unauthorized or without integrity gains access to the keys, then the system is working as designed. However, if the attacker plans to use the access as a foothold to further compromise the company, they will try to avoid tripwires. The value of the activity compared to the coins determines the type of tripwire; covert tripwires are better, but shared tripwires allow for a larger amount of funds available. Ultimately, the decision on which type of tripwire to use depends on the trade-off between the value of the activity and the available funds.</summary>
