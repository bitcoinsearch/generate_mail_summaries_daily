    <summary>The email conversation between Eric Voskuil and Pieter Wuille revolves around the issue of node identity proliferation, its impact on network privacy, and security. Pieter acknowledges that this is a valid concern, but he also points out that node identity is already being used in different ways, such as running multiple nodes in different locations and lists of 'good nodes.' He suggests using opportunistic encryption via BIP 151 and a simple optional pre-shared-secret authentication extension to improve upon pure IP-based authentication. Pieter further suggests splitting the transmission into different protocols based on bandwidth, connectivity, latency, and privacy concerns. Additionally, he recommends using a non-leaking public key authentication scheme that can give a TOFU-like security and does not require establishing real-world identity beyond what nodes already remember about IP addresses they've interacted with previously. However, Pieter recognizes that even with these improvements, there will always be limitations to network privacy and security.BIP151 proposes an ephemerally keyed opportunistic encryption system that will make the Bitcoin protocol faster and provide privacy against network observers. Without something like BIP151, network participants cannot have privacy for the transactions they originate within the protocol against network observers. The proposal makes interception strongly detectable after the fact when used with authentication. However, authenticated links through BIP151 cannot be counted on to provide protection against partitioning sybils, and manually curated links (addnode/connect) cannot provide protection either. The absence of authentication makes it necessary to trust other users without knowing if they are trustworthy or not. There are no consensus risks nor a requirement for coordinated change through the network. The cryptographic code can be directly reused from a well-known project (OpenSSH), and is very small in size.</summary>
