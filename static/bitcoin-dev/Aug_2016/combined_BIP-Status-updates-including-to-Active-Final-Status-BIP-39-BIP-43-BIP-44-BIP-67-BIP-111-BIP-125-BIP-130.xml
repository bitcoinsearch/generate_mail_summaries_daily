    <summary>Kenneth Heutmaker expressed concern in an email on August 23, 2016 that SPV (Simplified Payment Verification) is broken if the wallet does not detect whether nodes support bloom filtering. According to Heutmaker, the issue resulted in a large number of users reporting that their wallets were not being updated because it was not detecting the NODE_BLOOM bit. Furthermore, the problem compounded when users rescanned the blockchain and lost all transaction history, causing panic among less technical users. However, there are almost no NODE_BLOOM supporting bloom-off nodes on the network currently. Luke Dashjr noted that the design of bloom filtering makes it difficult for implementations to be robust to abusive peers. Meanwhile, Marek Palatinus suggested that BIP44 should be treated as final since it works well for most use cases.</summary>
