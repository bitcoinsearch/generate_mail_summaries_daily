    <summary>In an email conversation between Justus Ranvier and Gregory Maxwell on March 29th, 2014, they discussed the issue of dust transactions being dropped by fee/kB rules. Gregory suggested using dust-b-gone to relay the transaction to a third party, but Justus argued that this was sub-optimal as it introduced another party and there was no guarantee of their server remaining operational. Instead, Justus proposed starting the server oneself and aggregating multiple bits of dust in single transactions for greater efficiency. Later in the same email thread, Justus asked if there could be a standard output type for sending the entire transaction to miner fees, which would allow even large transactions to propagate that would normally be dropped by fee/kB rules. Gregory jokingly suggested calling it a "return operator".</summary>
