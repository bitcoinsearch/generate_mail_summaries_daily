    <summary>On October 15, 2015, a conversation thread started on the Bitcoin-Dev mailing list about Bitcoin-NG. The NG technique is designed to address scalability challenges faced by Bitcoin while simultaneously increasing throughput and reducing latency. It achieves this without affecting Bitcoin's open architecture or changing its trust model. Emin GÃ¼n Sirer noted that if NG was layered on top of Bitcoin, it would retain all the benefits of Bitcoin's retrospective blocks while adding the ability to mint microblocks with low latency in between.However, concerns were raised about how information would be managed and protected, and whether the Bitcoin-NG scheme could be designed or implemented in a way that supports privacy measures. For instance, there is no way to punish people if there is a double spend in a micro block that happens in a key block which reorgs away the first transaction. This means that users could no longer pick transactions in a mining pool that was set up in such a way because it could be tweaked to commit fraud at a much lower cost.Some participants suggested that users should wait before accepting a transaction to ensure there was no key-block missed, similar to waiting for a block in Bitcoin. However, this creates a complicated game theory, making it difficult to suggest accepting microblocks as confirmations are safe. Additionally, Greg Slepak brought up a good point on Twitter that this model means users could no longer pick transactions in a mining pool that had separate rewards and pubkeys, as the user could commit fraud at a much lower cost than the block's total reward. Ittay agrees that this is a significant practical issue, and closing off their only big win would be tragic. Fraud proof removes all the attacker's revenue, and the system will fall back to regular full blocks for confirmation times. Matt Corallo appreciated Ittay and Emin's efforts in this space and their willingness to work with the Bitcoin community on it. He thinks it still needs some tuning, but if the pool-mining issues were resolved, it could make block relay times irrelevant.Once a node generates a key block, it becomes the leader. As a leader, the node is allowed to generate microblocks at a set rate smaller than a predefined maximum. A microblock in Bitcoin-NG contains ledger entries and a header. While the system is not designed to support stealth sends, confidential transactions, or similar privacy measures because it doesn't contain proof of work, it has the potential to increase Bitcoin's scalability without compromising its existing infrastructure.</summary>
