    <summary>Pieter Wuille discussed various technical issues related to the development of Bitcoin in a series of emails. One email exchange involved Michael Gr√∏nager proposing to push libcoin to bitcoin and then build bitcoind bitcoin-qt on libcoin. Pieter likes the design of libcoin and its refactorings, but he is not fully convinced about its thread-safety. He suggests making each publicly accessible method of BlockChain grab either a reader lock (if it's a const function) or an upgradable lock, and take a writer lock in each method that performs changes.In another email, Pieter discussed the potential risks that could arise if two nodes connect twice to each other, especially with the move towards multiple local addresses with IPv6. He also talked about the need for encapsulation of wallet and blockchain data structures that allow making their mutexes private, leading to multithreaded RPC in a safe way without needing guesswork about which two calls may or may not be called simultaneously.Additionally, Pieter discussed the technical part of supporting IPv6, noting that most of the changes there have since been incorporated in netbase; however, some issues remain unresolved, such as how relaying will work and the risk of opening DoS or other vulnerabilities. Supporting IPv6 in a somewhat general way would pave the way for Bitcoin to function as a Tor or I2P hidden service by using onioncat-like tor-encoded-in-IPv6 addresses.</summary>
