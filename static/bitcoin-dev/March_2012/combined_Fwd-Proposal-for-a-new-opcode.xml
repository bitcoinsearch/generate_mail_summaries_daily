    <summary>In March 2012, Watson Ladd proposed a new opcode that would enable scripts to be given proof that the receiver can carry out or has carried out a previous transaction for anonymous transactions. The details of this proposal are not clear, and another alternative protocol has been suggested by an anonymous user. The alternative protocol involves N parties who want to purchase equal amounts of Bitcoin without the exchange being able to link their future transactions. They each put up the relevant amount of gold/whatever at the exchange, and the exchange provides its public key while the user provides a public key for signing. Externally, the participants agree on a collection of non-cooperating mixers, and each participant generates a new bitcoin address and encrypts it with the public keys of the exchange and all the mixers using an appropriate communicative homomorphic scheme. The participants combine their encrypted addresses into a block and hand it off to the mixing chain. Each mixer randomizes the order and decrypts all the messages with its key. At the end of the chain, the exchange does the final decryption and presents a list of addresses to the involved users. Users validate that their address is in the set and sign the entire set. Once all involved users have signed, the exchange pays. This protocol does not require any changes to the Bitcoin system and could be trivially implemented by anyone interested. It provides anonymity which is strong so long as any one of the mixers is uncompromised. It has very low overhead. It is not directly resistant to disruption, but if participation in an identified round requires a key provided by the exchange, abusive users can be detected and excluded.The anonymous user who suggested this alternative protocol asked Watson Ladd to contrast it with his proposal for the new opcode, which he did not fully understand. He wanted Ladd to explain how the opcode enables anonymous transactions and why it is not isomorphic to a hash locked transaction.</summary>
