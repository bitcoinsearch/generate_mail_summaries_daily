    <summary>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list in June of 2016, Peter Todd suggested that BIP75 be removed from the bips repository and boycotted by wallets that implement it. He argued that Bitcoin developers should not willingly participate in anti-money laundering (AML) or know your customer (KYC) practices. Pieter Wuille disagreed, pointing out that editorial control is inevitable to some extent, but it should be based on objective processes rather than personal opinions. He also called the suggestion to remove BIP75 "utterly ridiculous." The debate centered around whether or not editorial policies should be based on ethical and strategic grounds. Ultimately, the discussion highlights the tension between technical and moral considerations in the development of cryptocurrency.</summary>
