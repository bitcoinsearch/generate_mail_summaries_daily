    <summary>The discussion is about transactions that are not yet part of the chain. Jeff Garzik stated that a deterministic lifetime for a transaction could be provided, after which recovery procedures and transaction revisions could be initiated. This would also prevent zombie transactions from littering memory. However, Jorge Tim√≥n questioned how the chain could enforce this number and why clients couldn't delete those transactions right away.Gregory Maxwell clarified that the double spending transaction is not stored, which creates problems as when a transaction depending on the doublespend is received, its parent cannot be identified, so it is kept around as an orphan hoping its parent arrives. He suggested maintaining a cache of rejected txids to consult for orphan transaction's parents, but it would need to be dropped every time there is a reorg.Jeff Garzik mentioned that his public nodes currently have 2200+ and over time, clutter naturally occurs due to the disconnect between what miners mine and what relayers relay. There are bursts of weird transactions that quite a few miners are intentionally excluding. He proposed coming up with a good number that the network can agree upon to solve this problem.However, he also pointed out that nodes will repeat their transactions but not the unconfirmed parents, so being more aggressive can turn otherwise valid transactions into orphans. He suggested creating an archive-mempool, which is only checked when an orphan transaction is received. Finally, he cautioned that one cannot know a transaction would disappear since someone else could reannounce it.</summary>
