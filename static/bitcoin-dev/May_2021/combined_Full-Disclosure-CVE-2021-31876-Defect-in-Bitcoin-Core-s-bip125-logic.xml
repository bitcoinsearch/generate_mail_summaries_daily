    <summary>Antoine Riard has discovered a defect in Bitcoin Core bip125 logic that affects downstream projects such as LN, Onchain DLC/Coinswap/Vault, Coinjoin/Cut-Through, and Simple wallets. The Bip 125 specification describes two ways a transaction can signal that it is replaceable, explicit signaling and inherited signaling. However, Core's mempool rejects replacement attempts of an unconfirmed child transaction despite this behavior not being enforced. This issue has been present since the 2015's PR introducing the opt-in RBF. Antoine reported the defect to Dave Harding, who confirmed it and advised considering security implications for deployed second-layer protocols. He also disclosed the defect to the Bitcoin Core security list, recommending avoiding a covert patch in the mempool as risks of introducing DoS in this part of the codebase seemed to outweigh security of deployed LN channels.The lack of an established policy for coordinated security disclosures between a base layer implementation and its downstream projects, the lack of a clear methodology to identify downstream projects affected by a transaction relay policy wreckage, and the lack of minimally-disruptive, emergency upgrade mechanisms implemented by downstream projects are few interesting points underlying this long-standing defect with benign security implications providing an opportunity to exercise coordinated security disclosure across layers and development teams.LN nodes operators concerned by this defect might favor anchor outputs channels, fully mitigating this specific pinning vector. The defect was disclosed to the LN projects maintainers, informing them that currently in deployment anchor outputs protocol upgrade was mitigating against this defect though old channels will stay vulnerable. Antione recommends that any in-protocol competing transactions explicitly signal RBF and invites RBF engines dev to verify what those components are doing in the light of disclosed information. Finally, security implications for downstream projects provoked by base layer issues shouldn't be minimized as they do have a risk of windblow on base layer operations. Antione believes we should minimize risks of disaster scenarios such as thousands of LN channels manually closed by worried operators due to a non-concerted security disclosure, provoking mempool cloaks and disrupting regular transactions for a while.</summary>
