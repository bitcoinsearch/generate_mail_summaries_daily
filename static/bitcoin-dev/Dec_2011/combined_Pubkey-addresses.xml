    <summary>Jorge Tim√≥n has raised a query about saving space by putting the whole public key instead of just the address with each output. Currently, a send-to-address puts the address in the output script, whereas redeeming requires the full pubkey plus the signature to be placed in the input script. However, if they use a send-to-pubkey, the output would contain the pubkey and the input would contain the signature, which would save more space than the previous method. There are several possible improvements, including compressed public keys, compact signatures, and pubkey recovery that require a change to the scripting language. Several combinations of these improvements could be proposed, including send-to-pubkeys-hash, send-to-recovered-pubkeys-hash-with-compact-signature-inside-op_eval, send-to-pubkey, send-to-compressed-pubkey, and send-to-compressed-pubkeys-hash. Gregory Maxwell made a small table to compare these options. If pruning is considered, pay-to-address + key recovery is better than pay-to-compressed pubkey. Luke-Jr proposed that full public key addresses be required to be "compact" (length 33) and use version 21. However, no currently deployed software knows how to spend it or receive it, and using op-eval2+recovery creates seriously bloated transactions where there is pruning. Matt suggested that under no circumstances should the use of firstbits ever be supported because it doesn't scale and provides incentives for people to spam the chain to get a firstbits address.</summary>
