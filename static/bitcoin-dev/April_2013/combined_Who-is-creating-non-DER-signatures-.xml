    <summary>Bitcoin uses DER-encoded signatures in its transactions, and OpenSSL which is used to verify them accepts extra data than the strict DER specification. However, it's not good for the Bitcoin block validity rules to depend on OpenSSL. Therefore, a rule is proposed to make non-standard signatures invalid. Pieter Wuille has monitored all transactions for the past few weeks and found that 0.6% of transactions have at least one non-standard signature. A patch was recently merged to enforce strict encodings for transactions into the memory pool, but such transactions will still likely make it into blocks until miners and other nodes upgrade their systems. When the rate of non-standard encodings drops far enough, a soft forking change can be attempted to make it required so that network rules would no longer depend on OpenSSL's parsers. The rules now enforced are strictly DER-encoded signatures, compressed or uncompressed public keys, and no padding before or after the hash type byte. The harm caused by these non-standard encodings depends on how they are created, but all transactions can be mutated to an acceptable form.</summary>
