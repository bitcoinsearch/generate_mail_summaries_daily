    <summary>A proposal has been made to define a new address type called P2SH^2 which is similar to P2SH but instead of H(ScriptPubKey), it is H(H(ScriptPubKey)). This creates a hash of a P2SH address. A relay rule is suggested where to relay a P2SH^2 address, the inner P2SH address must be included and all nodes can easily verify it by hashing it. If miners mine P2SH^2 addresses without relaying the P2SH, a block discouragement rule would be introduced if the P2SH^2 pre-images are not received. This change ensures that there is no non-prunable location for users to cram data into except values, deterring data storage in values as it has a high computational cost. The proposal does not prevent value commitment, just data storage.</summary>
