    <summary>A developer named Adam Ritter who had zero experience with Bitcoin development and codebase, proposed implementing integration tests for Bitcoin. He wrote a short document of what he thought would be the safest way to do the testing, but not the tests themselves since he didn't have enough experience. His plan included simulating multiple Bitcoin users and verifying that the whole network of Bitcoin clients work together to achieve the goals of Bitcoin. He suggested calling these tests 'system tests'. The Bitcoin community uses a system called blocktester that Matt Corallo wrote. It's based on BitcoinJ and works by simulating a peer against a slightly instrumented copy of Bitcoin(d/-qt) (modified to avoid computationally expensive mining). The tests simulate many complicated network scenarios and test the boundaries of many (hopefully all) the particular rules of the blockchain validation protocol. These tests are run as part of the automated tests on every proposed patch to the reference software.Additionally, the community runs a public secondary test Bitcoin network called 'testnet', which can be accessed by anyone by starting the reference software with testnet=1. Testnet operates the same as the production network except it allows mining low difficulty blocks to prevent it going for long times without blocks, and some of the protective relaying rules against "non standard" transaction types are disabled. Most of this testing work has been centered around validating the blockchain behavior because that's what has serious systemic risk. Measuring the JSON RPC behavior is strictly less interesting, though interesting too.</summary>
