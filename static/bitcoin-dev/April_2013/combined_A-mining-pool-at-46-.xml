    <summary>Mike Hearn expressed concerns about P2pool's ability to handle FPGA/ASIC hardware and its lack of growth. However, P2pool was found to work well with FPGAs, but not with old BFL FPGA miners or Avalon due to latency issues. The network saw a significant increase in TH when ASICminer came online mining on BTCguild and the first Avalons started to ship, while P2Pool remained mostly constant. Despite this, ForrestV, the author and maintainer of P2pool software, would like to work on making Avalon and other higher latency devices first class supported on P2Pool. Melvin Carvalho asked about the risk of a 51% attack, which is a bit confused as it is not necessarily a magic number. None of the pools listed on blockchain.info/pools are meaningfully decentralized except for P2Pool, which is decentralized based on the same technology as Bitcoin itself. However, it is not as easy to use as a centralized pool. The major pool operators are generally trustworthy, but the more likely threat is that their systems get hacked or they are subjected to coercion. It is important to know what kind of threat a large amount of hash-power poses. Someone with &gt;50% of the hashpower can replace confirmed blocks with an alternative chain containing different transactions, allowing them to reverse and respend their own transactions. This doesn't require a magic "51%" number. Additionally, an attacker with only 40% of the hashpower can reverse six confirmations with a success rate of ~50%.</summary>
