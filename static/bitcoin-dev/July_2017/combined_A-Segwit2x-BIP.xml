    <summary>On July 13, 2017, Sergio Demian Lerner updated the BIP with technical improvements which included an increase in maximum block sigops after HF. He also added comments regarding the worst-case block size and encouraged signaling before block 475776, which was just 90 blocks away.However, Lerner's proposal was criticized for carrying an extreme risk of parties losing money due to transaction reversals at two distinct points in time and providing no proposed countermeasures to avoid these losses. The proposal also added another gratuitous limit to the system: a maximum transaction size where none existed before. Yet, this limit was almost certainly too small to prevent actual DOS attacks while it was technically larger than any transaction that can be included today.A proposal to activate Segwit has been made, involving replacing "segsignal" with "segwit2x." However, this proposal does not distinguish itself from BIP-91. While activating segwit would reduce fee pressures on users and companies, it also disrupts the fee market and doesn't improve scalability. This proposal is only a temporary solution that buys time for more comprehensive solutions to be developed and tested.Furthermore, there is no mention of remediation against replay exposure, which creates further risks. The specification section is under-specified, as some of the details are confusing or insufficient. The proposed change may not even work as there are no tests implemented for it. Overall, the proposal seems to lack justification and exacerbates the risks by being the product of a closed process.Earlier, on July 7, 2017, Luke Dashjr stated that larger block sizes were not likely to have a meaningful impact on fee pressure.In summary, Sergio Demian Lerner's proposal had technical improvements but was criticized for its potential risks, whereas the proposal to activate Segwit lacked justification and created further risks. Both proposals were temporary solutions that did not address scalability issues comprehensively.</summary>
