    <summary>The discussion between Paul Sztorc and Gregory Maxwell is centered on the topic of roadmaps for Bitcoin's development. Paul has written a roadmap that he believes represents Core/developer positions, but Maxwell disagrees with its content and approach. Maxwell suggests that the idea of a roadmap is not helpful in creating more communication or achieving shared intentions, and instead proposes private polling of major actors to determine their opinions. Maxwell also expresses concerns about transparency and potential misconduct if proposals are laundered through an apparently unaffiliated third party. The conversation touches on various topics such as hard forks, security models, and mining centralization.In contrast to the idea of a roadmap, a participant in another discussion argues that roadmaps are not effective for communicating research that is still in the exploratory stages. They suggest that the industry needs to develop better communication channels, such as those found in the Linux world, where semi-experts can communicate with one another and explain technical concepts to different levels of expertise. The participant advocates for a more collaborative approach to developing the Bitcoin system, rather than relying on centralized roadmaps or edicts.Bitcoin development is ongoing with several features already available to users, such as version bits, compact block relay, FIBRE, CSV, and better fee estimation. However, segregated witness is awaiting consensus. Lightning network and light client mode for bitcoin core are currently under active development with concrete specifications. Other draft proposals at the experimental stage include transaction compression, schnorr sig aggregation, drivechain, spoonnet, mimblewimble, and block size increases. Ideas that aren't even experiments yet include asicboost prevention.Drivechains/sidechains and other experimental approaches are welcome, but their security model is very distinct from Bitcoin's and arguably not very good, given the current highly centralized mining ecosystem. Therefore, positioning them as a major solution for the Bitcoin project is the wrong way to go. Instead, people should be encouraged to try cool stuff at their own risk. Grandly stated "top-down" roadmaps in highly collaborative development are of minimal utility at best and actively misleading at worst.The Linux kernel has a more functional pathway to disagreement than Bitcoin for consensus rules, in part due to the fact that they have far more contributing resources from far more sources and a fairly centralized model. While Bitcoin can talk about research as an exploration, it is not possible to nail down when new ideas will be ready until they are; forecasting at the individual contribution level may be more effective. It is also important to note that collaborative innovation is very hard to stick to a tight schedule and prospective technology roadmaps are not productive for the industry. Rather than attempting to forecast technological advancements, it is suggested that Bitcoin focus on timely and reliable releases.Juniper made it 10 years with regular timed releases, which did not slip by more than three days and were all production deployable. This was only possible because features were not guaranteed in a release; if a feature failed during final testing and required more than trivial fixes, it was removed or disabled. The public discussion around SegWit occurred before the pull request, which was done for solid political reasons, but was ill-timed. CSV and CLTV, on the other hand, were not discussed until they were merged, which was much more compatible with 'roadmapping' +/- activation uncertainty.While it is possible to talk in a visionary sense about the sorts of things Bitcoin is exploring, it isn't possible to guarantee when they'll be ready until they are. It's important to note that some of the pressure to forecast dates for major advancements comes from competitive pressure with things like Ethereum or other altcoins which have a lot lower commitment to engineering integrity or even logical consistency. In terms of scalability improvements, Drivechains and several earlier sidechains ideas are not viewed as such, but merely enabling users to opt-in for another security model. While anyone is free to choose their security model, this particular one is not viewed as interesting. In terms of validation cost to auditors, it is as bad as just a capacity increase on chain while simultaneously adding the extra risk of miners being able to vote to steal users' money.</summary>
