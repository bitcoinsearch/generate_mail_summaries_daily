    <summary>The context is a proposal to increase the utility of BIP125 by making transactions that spend an unconfirmed BIP125 output non-standard. The aim is to support a healthy fee marketplace and prevent receivers from spending or sweeping before confirmation. The policy specifies a max chain depth of 1 for any BIP125 transactions, meaning receivers will need to wait until the transaction has confirmed before spending from it. If senders want to make further transactions before the BIP125 transaction confirms and need to utilize the change of the transaction, they will need to replace the transaction with one that makes the other send in "pass through" style or first finalize the BIP125 transaction and then chain from the spend normally. This proposal is contrary to miner income as it asks miners to ignore these spends, which could lead to higher volatility. Instead, a BIP that advises parties not to spend unconfirmed outputs from third parties while making a payment to third parties could achieve the same goal.</summary>
