    <summary>The Bitcoin-development mailing list has been discussing the efficiency of existing implementations, and the potential for improvements in protocol and implementation to increase efficiency. Mark Friedenbach suggested implementing everything in-protocol, which Pieter has already done with headers first on Github.Justus Ranvier argued that there is no doubt that current implementations are inefficient, but that full nodes could be operated with fewer resources with improved implementation. Brian Hoffman asked about disk storage constraints, and pointed out the possibility of pruning, while Natanael suggested bundling Stratum and allowing SPV wallets to connect to it, although this may increase resource utilization.The conversation discusses the option of implementing error correction to increase efficiency in block relaying for bitcoin. However, it is noted that it may not be necessary for the basic protocol due to locality problems and asymptotic failure rates. Additionally, it is suggested that diversity in p2p protocols would be beneficial for the network.The discussion also explores the idea of using service bits or extending addr messages to indicate availability of blocks, with the suggestion of a hybrid approach. It is noted that signaling the actual blocks available upon connection would be more important than general degree of availability, while keeping in mind the changing nature of available blocks.It is suggested that nodes serving blocks should at least have the last N blocks stored to ensure safety against reorgs and optimal contribution based on request patterns. Finally, the implementation of storing and serving full blocks being configurable to ranges is discussed, with the need for changes to the P2P protocol and client modifications.</summary>
