    <summary>In an email thread from April 2014, a user named Un Ix suggested that the proposed unit of 1/1,000,000th of a Bitcoin be called "bits." However, Pieter Wuille, a developer, believed that what units are colloquially called is not up to developers. He argued that it will vary depending on language and culture, and thus having an official name for this unit as "bits" in software would be confusing. Instead, he argued for a more distinctive name. Tamas Blummer agreed with Pieter's perspective, stating that wallet developers should discuss this topic rather than engineers discussing it. Rob Golding disagreed with the idea of using prefixes altogether, believing that it is unnecessary and could cause confusion. He also proposed that users just use satoshis if they cannot understand what a bitcoin is.</summary>
