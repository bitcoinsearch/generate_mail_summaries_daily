    <summary>The discussion thread on the Bitcoin development mailing list covers several topics related to Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs), including BIP 64 and BIP 32. BIP 64 is a proposal for defining a purpose ID for wallets that would allow them to support multiple subwallets. The participants debated whether these subwallets should share a common piece of private key material or if they should have different security policies. They also discussed how strict the structure of BIP64 should be and whether wallets that do not support all accounts as specified by BIP64 should be considered BIP64 compliant. BIP 32, on the other hand, can be used for subwallets, multisig addresses, and recurring payments. It has a looser definition of accounts than BIP 64. There was some debate about whether funds across accounts should mix or remain isolated from one another. Additionally, there was discussion about the idea of using a Litecoin seed in BIP32 HMAC, which was ultimately deemed a bad idea.In a discussion about the purpose of 'cointype' in BIP32, various opinions were shared. Pieter Wuille suggested that different chains should use independent chains and have serializations encode which chain they belong to. He suggested that to derive the master node from the seed, the key string "Bitcoin seed" is replaced by something chain-specific. Every encoded node (including master nodes) has a chain-specific serialization magic. Slush agreed with Pieter's suggestion, except he noted that it wouldn't allow for a way to encode the "super master" that is the parent of all chain-specific masters. Slush offered an alternative suggestion that allows using one seed across different chains, but the master nodes are separate. The key string "Bitcoin seed" is replaced by something chain-specific. Every encoded node (including master nodes) has a chain-specific serialization magic. Pieter Wuille still didn't understand the purpose of cointype. He suggested that if you don't want to risk reusing the same keys across different currencies, just don't use the same seed or the same account. That is purely a client-side issue. If consensus is to add the cointype anyway, Pieter asked to fix it to be equal to the 4-byte magic in the serialization after setting the high bit to true. This way, there aren't two 4-byte magic codes that need to be defined for each, and at the same time make it obvious from the serialized form what it is for.After some off-list discussion about details with wallet developers, Slush concluded that structure m/'/'// fulfill requirements of all wallet developers around. Some participants suggested using serialization formats for extra designated uses instead of trying to fit them into the derivation structure.</summary>
