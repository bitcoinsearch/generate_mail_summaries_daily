    <summary>The email conversation in question begins with Tom Zander responding to Johnson Lau's suggestion about preparing for a potential hard fork with unknown parameters. Tom asks for specific suggestions and provides examples such as using FlexTran, changing the block interval, and fixing the sighash bug for legacy scripts. Emin GÃ¼n Sirer responds to a reference made regarding a study on the Bitcoin P2P network, stating that the 4MB limit mentioned in the paper should not be used as a protocol limit today due to the emergence of high-speed block relay networks like Falcon and FIBRE, as well as block compression technologies.Juan Garavaglia disagrees with the conclusions of the study, arguing that many of the estimations are outdated and suggesting that raising the block size limit to 32MB by the next halving is possible based on technological advancements. Alphonse Pace provides a link to a study showing that even 4MB is unsafe, but Juan argues that whether it is unsafe or impossible is a different topic. Finally, Alphonse questions Wang Chun's proposal of removing the limit and relying on the p2p protocol, as it can lead to differing consensus if alternative layers for relaying are used.A proposal has been put forward to remove the block size limit of 1MB from Bitcoin Core's next release, but not activate it until spring 2020. The idea was proposed by Wang Chun in Hong Kong Consensus last year, but was rejected by Coredevs at that meeting. The patch would only limit the block size to 32MiB, which is already the maximum size that the current p2p protocol allows. This would allow third-party services, libraries, wallets, and exchanges enough time to prepare for the fork scheduled in spring 2020. Despite this, there is no agreement on how to increase the block size limit, and many miners may be removed from the network if the limit is increased too quickly. However, some argue that the hard fork approach is risky and should instead be left up to users, with Core adding a run-time option to allow node operators to increase the block size limit. The consensus is that any decision must come from the community rather than just Core.Wang Chun, an active Bitcoin miner, proposed a hard fork approach to Bitcoin's block size limit. The proposal is to code a patch that removes the 1MB limit at the next block halving in Spring 2020 and limits the block size to 32MiB, which is the maximum size allowed by the current p2p protocol. This patch must be in the immediate next release of Bitcoin Core. With this patch, Bitcoin works just as before, no fork will occur until spring 2020. But everyone knows there will be a fork scheduled. Third-party services, libraries, wallets, and exchanges will have enough time to prepare for it over the next three years. This proposal allows enough time to discuss all the proposals over the past years and decide which one to go with. Hard fork proposals, with this patch already in Core's release, they all become soft fork. The proposal was initially rejected by core developers but was brought up again for discussion.</summary>
