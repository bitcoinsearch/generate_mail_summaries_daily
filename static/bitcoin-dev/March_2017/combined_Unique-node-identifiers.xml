    <summary>The email thread is about the proposal for visible node identities on the Bitcoin network and whether they are necessary or not. Eric Voskuil argues that weak identity is insufficient to produce the problem scenario at the heart of his concern. He believes that BIP150 is an extension of IP addresses and more secure against network-level attackers. Pieter Wuille responds by saying that having verifiable identity keys in the P2P is just a cryptographic tool to keep a certain class of attackers from bypassing restrictions that people can already make. Jonas Schnelli via bitcoin-dev says that there is a difference between identification/fingerprinting and proving identity, and that BIP150 only facilitates the latter. He believes that BIP150 is an extension of IP addresses, except more secure against network-level attackers. He also points out that if you know an IP/onion address + BIP150 PSK, you can verify whether some node has it. Overall, the discussion focuses on whether visible node identities would be useful or not, and what the potential implications of implementing such a system might be.</summary>
