    <summary>In a mailing list, Sergio Demian Lerner presented a proposal called Segwit2Mb to merge the current SegWit activation with a 2MB block size hard-fork. This would be activated only if 95% of miners signalled for it and at a fixed future date. The objective is to reunite the Bitcoin community and avoid a cryptocurrency split.Matt Corallo, in response, suggested that Lerner had ignored two years of Bitcoin hardfork research and recycling BIP 102 from 2015 would make the hard fork riskier instead of avoiding technical changes. Corallo recommended several technical changes should be considered such as replay protection and additional commitments at the top of the merkle root. He also raised concerns about the significant risks to the Bitcoin ecosystem due to the parameters set by Lerner.One of his primary concerns was the effect of the many technological innovations coming down the pipe in the coming months, which could significantly reduce fee pressure as transactions move to much faster and more featureful systems. Commitments to aggressive hard fork parameters now may leave miners without much revenue as far out as the next halving. Additionally, he suggested that there aren't many great technical solutions to some of these issues, as far as he's aware, but it's something that needs to be incredibly carefully considered before betting the continued security of Bitcoin on exponential on-chain growth, something which we have historically never seen.In a proposal by Sergio Demian Lerner for a hard fork called segwit2Mb, it is suggested that the 1 Mb restriction on transactions be kept to prevent worsening block verification time due to an O(N^2) hashing problem. He also suggests delaying the activation date of the hard fork to allow enough time for all active economic nodes to upgrade their systems. Currently, 91% of network nodes have upgraded to post 0.12 versions of Bitcoin Core, which can identify economic active nodes through dynamic fees introduced in this release.Lerner believes in a unified Bitcoin community and encourages developers to give their opinions and make suggestions for unlocking the current Bitcoin deadlock. Contributions to the segwit2mb project are welcomed with the limitation that the patch should be as simple to audit as possible. Improvements unrelated to a 2 Mb increase or segwit should not be part of segwit2Mb. The proposal is only a starting point and community feedback is expected and welcomed.Sergio Demian Lerner has proposed a project called Segwit2Mb to merge into Bitcoin a minimal patch that aims to untangle the current conflict between different political positions regarding segwit activation versus an increase of the on-chain blockchain space through a standard block size increase. The primary objective of this proposal is to re-unite the Bitcoin community and avoid a cryptocurrency split, which does not imply a compromise to the future scalability or decentralization of Bitcoin, as a small increase in block size has been proven by several core and non-core developers not to affect Bitcoin value propositions.The tentative lock-in and hard-fork dates are from April 29th, 2017, to August 29th, 2017, and Thu, 14 Dec 2017 00:00:00 GMT, respectively. The hard-fork is conditional to 95% of the hashing power approving the segwit2mb soft-fork and the segwit soft-fork is activated. It is suggested to delay the hard-fork date if there is a real need to. Most of the community agrees that halting the innovation for several years is a very bad option.Regarding the technical issues, there aren't many great technical solutions to some of these issues, as far as Sergio is aware, but it's something that needs to be incredibly carefully considered before betting the continued security of Bitcoin on exponential on-chain growth, something historically never seen. The worst-case scenario is that a 2X block size increase has much lower economic impact than the last bitcoin halving.The proof of concept patch was made for Bitcoin Core, but it should be easily ported to other Bitcoin protocol implementations that already support versionbits. Lightweight (SPV) wallets should not be affected as they generally do not check the block size. Contributions to the segwit2mb project are welcomed and awaited, with the only limitation being to stick to the principle that the patch should be as simple to audit as possible. This proposal should not prevent other consensus proposals to be simultaneously merged, and it is expected and welcomed of community feedback.</summary>
