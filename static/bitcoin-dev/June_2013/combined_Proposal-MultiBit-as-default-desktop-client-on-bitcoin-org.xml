    <summary>In an email exchange on June 27, 2013, Luke-Jr and Jeff Garzik discussed the possibility of a net reduction of full nodes on P2P network. Luke-Jr expressed his concern about even a reduction of listening bitcoinj or MultiBit node. He asked Jim if MultiBit would be adding p2p listening support. However, without validation, listening isn't currently very useful. It could be somewhat more with some protocol additions.Jim replied to the email stating that being able to promote a fast SPV desktop wallet would be great. He went through a cycle of testing on multibit after seeing some complaints when it went up on the page before without a lot of discussion. There were a number of issues at the time, including frequent deadlocks. Although Mike was saying that those should be fixed, some of the other things concerning Jim were still uncorrected. For example, no proxy support (so users can't follow recommended best practices of using it with Tor), reusing addresses (especially for change), and not clearly distinguishing confirmation level. It also made repeated https connections to 141.101.113.245. Jim asked if there was any timeframe for changing any of this stuff.</summary>
