    <summary>John Law has proposed an alternative to BIP-118 called Inherited IDs (IIDs) that offers a safer and more powerful option for Bitcoin scaling while improving usability. The proposal involves adding a new resettable "structural" transaction identifier called an "iid" to each UTXO and identifying input transactions using this method when signing, making it much safer than floating transactions. IIDs have at least one native SegWit output with version 2 and a 32-byte witness program called an "IID output." The proposal supports a 2-party channel protocol called 2Stage that achieves eltoo's improvements, eliminates the need for watchtowers, and has constant worst-case on-chain costs. The IID proposal offers three options for adding IIDs to Bitcoin via a softfork.John Law also proposed introducing guidelines on how to post to the mailing list without compromising identity. While the implementation requires changes to how signatures are evaluated and applications that use the new feature are written, ANYPREVOUT doesn't need changes beyond that. The proposal includes a 2-stage protocol as an alternative to eltoo, which works for two participants, while multisig factories work for more than two participants.The eltoo protocol, which BIP-118 supports, improves upon the Lightning protocol for 2-party channels by simplifying the protocol, eliminating penalty transactions, and supporting late determination of transaction fees. BIP-118 supports multi-party channel factories via the eltoo protocol, but the IID proposal supports channel factories that are far more scalable and powerful than any previously proposed channel factories, which can be combined with the 2Stage protocol to create trust-free and watchtower-free channels including large numbers of casual users.Law requests anyone interested in the proposal to review his paper and choose the best option for adding IIDs to Bitcoin and create a BIP for that option. With the Inherited IDs proposal, Bitcoin scaling can be achieved while improving usability, making it a safer and more powerful option.</summary>
