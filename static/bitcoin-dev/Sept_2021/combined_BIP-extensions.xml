    <summary>BIPs are proposals that begin as ideas, are formulated and discussed on this list, and assuming no glaring flaws are observed, turned into pull requests to the bips repository, assigned a BIP number by the editors, and merged. They are then organically incorporated into the various entities that exist in the Bitcoin space. BIPs are modified for primarily three reasons: 1) To improve on their description without changing what is actually proposed, 2) to improve the proposal in some way, e.g. after discussion or after getting feedback on the proposed approach, and 3) to add missing content, such as activation strategy.The proposer suggests that changes of the second and third type, unless they are absolutely free from contention, are done as BIP extensions. BIP extensions are separate BIPs that extend on or an existing BIP. By making extensions to BIPs, rather than modifying them long after review, they are giving the community the assurance that a BIP will mostly remain in its form forever, except if an obvious win is discovered, the ability to judge modifications to BIPs, such as activation parameters, on their merits alone, and the path to propose modifications to BIPs even if their authors have gone inactive and cease to provide feedback, as is the case for many BIPs today, as BIP extensions do not require the approval of the extended-upon BIP.The proposer also suggests an alternative way to handle draft BIPs and those in Active/Final state. The brand new BIP draft comes in from its authors/champions/whatever, number xxx gets assigned, it becomes "Draft BIP xxx" and once the authors are happy with the text, they can move it to Final status, at which point it is no longer a draft and is just "BIP xxx", and doesn't get modified anymore. The author doubts that it's very useful to have an "Active" state as distinct from "Final. The author suggests that having BIP maintainers exercising judgement by trying to reserve/assign "pretty" numbers seems like a mistake. Instead, for new BIPs, make a PR, putting the text into drafts/bip-authorname-description.mediawiki (with corresponding directory for images etc). Only after the draft is already merged is a BIP number assigned and moved to the main directory. When a BIP becomes Final, it gets moved from drafts/ into the main directory, and likewise when a BIP becomes rejected/deprecated/whatever, it's moved into historical/. Finally, don't allow any modifications to BIPs outside of drafts/, with the possible exception of adding additional info in Acknowledgements or See also section or similar, adding Superseded-By: links, and updating additional tables that are deliberately designed to be updated, eg bip-0009/assignments.mediawiki.</summary>
