    <summary>Eric Voskuil argues that the block space created by a miner is their property, which can be sold or not. However, miners are currently being paid around $130k USD per block in the form of inflation for following the Bitcoin protocol. He also suggests that miners have no more right to do this than users have the right to run software that invalidates their coinbase outputs. Nathan Parker proposes a solution to the problem of miners filling their blocks with transactions paying high fees at no cost. Parker's solution involves enforcing miners to set an anyone-can-spend output in the coinbase transaction of the block. The miner of 100 blocks after the current one can add a secondary transaction spending the anyone-can-spend coinbase transaction and claim the funds. This way, the block reward of a block X is always transferred to the miner of block X+100. The implementation would require a soft-fork and may cause a temporary drop in hashrate.</summary>
