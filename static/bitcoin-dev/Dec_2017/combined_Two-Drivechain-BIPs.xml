    <summary>A new development in the world of Bitcoin is Drivechain, which has recently become more than just vaporware. The Drivechain Project has released a code offering, with only M1 and M8_V2 being unfinished. The project has been acknowledged as having tolerable documentation/BIP drafts. Two BIP drafts have been submitted, namely the Hashrate Escrow and Blind Merged Mining proposals. The Drivechain team has requested formal BIP numbers for these drafts and is requesting code review to ensure their stability. The request is open to regular review, however, the updated FAQ must be read before contributing.</summary>
