    <summary>A recent discussion on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list has raised concerns about the implementation of a dead man's switch to Bitcoin addresses. The proposed system would cause Bitcoins assigned to dormant addresses to automatically expire after a fixed period of time, potentially causing devastating outcomes for those who want to save long term. The system could force people to move funds around in order to not get nullified and introduces multiple opportunities for errors. Cold storage should be able to stay cold and implementing this kind of system could create terrible incentives for miners to censor transactions that move funds close to their expiration time, increasing their future rewards. Approximately 4 million of the 16.4 million Bitcoins ever mined are lost forever because no one knows the private keys of some Bitcoin addresses. This effectively means that only 14.4 million Bitcoins are in circulation, even though 16.4 million have been mined. As there is no way of eliminating the human errors that cause these losses of Bitcoin from circulation, the total number of Bitcoins in circulation will eventually become zero, bringing the network to an end. The solution proposed by the BIP is to implement a dead man's switch to Bitcoin addresses. Dormant addresses that are not used in transactions for a fixed length of time, such as ten years, would automatically expire. The calculation of the miner's reward should take into account the Bitcoins that have expired, which means there is a possibility of an increase in miner's rewards if a sufficient number of Bitcoins expire.</summary>
