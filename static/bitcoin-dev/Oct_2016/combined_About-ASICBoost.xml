    <summary>In a series of emails between Bitcoin developers, concerns were raised about the centralization pressure being put on Bitcoin by ASICBoost, a technology which allows miners to use less energy to mine Bitcoins. One developer, Sergio Demian Lerner, posted guidelines for correcting the Bitcoin design flaw that allowed this to occur, though he also filed a patent for his ASICBoost optimization. Another developer, Matt Corallo, criticized Lerner for not being transparent with his patent and not considering the potential harm to Bitcoin’s decentralization. Lerner had previously reached out to the Bitcoin Foundation to license his patent in a fair and open way, but was told it was not a big deal. The discussion highlights concerns over how patents could potentially harm Bitcoin’s growth and decentralization.</summary>
