    <summary>Bitcoin developers are discussing a proposal to commit to every spent scriptPubKey and therefore every element of the TxOut instead of just the amount. The purpose is to make it possible for signers to determine whether they can safely sign with just O(1) information per input. This approach would not increase the per-signature hashing while retaining the ability to cache information across BIP141/BIP341. However, coinbaseness and height are things currently kept track of in the UTXO set but have low utility and slow down review. Committing to the signature hashes for key-path spends is not extensible with future soft forks; thus, it's essential to get these things right from the start.</summary>
