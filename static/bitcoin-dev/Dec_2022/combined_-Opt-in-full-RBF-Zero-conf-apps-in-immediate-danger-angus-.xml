    <summary>The addition of Full RBF by Bitcoin Core has raised concerns among proponents of zero-conf transactions. They believe that it can potentially increase the risk of double-spends. However, some argue that the risk of double-spends with zero-conf transactions has always existed and is more concerning for larger transactions. Additionally, relying on node policy to protect zero-conf transactions is seen as fragile, as it is not a consensus rule.In the long-term, Lightning Network is suggested as a solution for fast and risk-free instant payments. Proponents of zero-conf transactions also see it as a useful tool in improving Lightning onboarding, rebalancing, splicing, and overall user experience. The article discusses the importance of miners' long-term view in supporting zeroconf and preventing 51% attacks. It is argued that miners prioritizing long-term income can prevent 51% attacks from being a dominant strategy. The lack of regular reorgs is also considered a benefit of zeroconf transactions.The CEO of Synonym.to has called for the removal of the mempoolfullrbf feature from Bitcoin Core distributions, citing the disruptive effect it could have on mempool harmony. While full RBF is already out in the wild at around 5%+ of running nodes, it is speculated that if Bitcoin Core publishes an update without the feature, the mempoolfullrbf movement is likely to die on the vine as users opt into the latest versions.The outcome of Full RBF may not necessarily be positive, as it could lead to a decrease in on-chain traffic and fee income if everyone switches to lightning or stablecoins/ETH. The impact of reducing transaction volume by 5-10% is uncertain, but it may not matter directly since fee income is only about 2% of the block reward. However, if there is a negative effect on demand for bitcoin due to slower confirmation times, driving its price down, that could dominate. Once around 10%-30% of hashrate is mining with Full RBF, it may make it too easy to cheat anyone willing to accept txs signaling first-seen-final with 0 confirmations, causing everyone to switch to lightning or stablecoins/ETH.The article highlights the importance of consistent and predictable relay policy across nodes. The author argues that RBF is actually a fee-minimization feature that allows users to spend the least amount in fees that correlates to their time-preference. The risk exposure to merchants providing zero-conf acceptance as a service is finite, capped by their risk-tolerance, and capped by the current block exposure. Merchants cap their exposure to be an amount worth less than the value of this service.The article concludes by saying that full RBF is aligned with miner (and user) economic incentives and that miners care about max fees per block, not slightly increased fees on a minority % of incidentally replaced txns when they happen to need it. They want the most txns for the highest price per block.</summary>
