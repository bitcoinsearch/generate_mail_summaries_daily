    <summary>Jeff Garzik expressed his concern over the difficulty of creating and predicting a stable block size and fee environment with pay-with-diff across months. He mentioned that unpredictability and chaos could lead to negative impacts on markets and systems. According to him, businesses would face difficulties in planning due to the volatility of the system. Jeff Garzik also warned about the potential for collusion and the need for idle hash power for paying with difficulty. Contrarily, Greg Maxwell argued that increasing the block size quickly with difficulty over a narrow window could be profitable for miners if there is a good supply of transactions paying real fees comparable to those already taken. He said that mining is not a race, and increasing the difficulty does not put one at an expected return disadvantage compared to other miners as long as the income increases proportionally. Additionally, he pointed out that pay-for-size schemes have been successfully used in some altcoins without the effects mentioned by Jeff Garzik. Later, Jorge Tim√≥n clarified that Jeff Garzik's arguments were not applicable to Greg Maxwell's original proposal where the size is only increased for that block rather than permanently. Finally, Jeff Garzik's characterization of pay-with-difficulty involving idle hash power was questioned by Greg Maxwell, who asked him to explain it further.</summary>
