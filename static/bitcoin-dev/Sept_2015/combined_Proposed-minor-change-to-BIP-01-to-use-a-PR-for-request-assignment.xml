    <summary>The BIP01 process was written using a different solution for storing and presenting BIPs. A suggestion has been made to change the number request process to opening a pull request with BIP text without a number. Instead, the author's name and an index would be used as the number to request assignment. The question is whether anyone would object to this change. Marco Pontello responded that he sees no objection and was about to ask for details regarding this part of the process. The previous use of a WIKI page for all the BIP stuff worked better in their opinion but using GitHub was a step forward in several ways; however, it made the number assignment part an odd duck. They should have fixed it then, but it wasn't obvious enough at the time.</summary>
