    <summary>During Scaling Bitcoin, Bitcoin Core committers and notable contributors discussed where a "greatest common denominator" type consensus might be. They were interested in a hard fork to modify the block size limit regime to be cost-based via "net-utxo" rather than a simple static hard limit. 2-4-8 and 17%/year were debated as short term bumps that seemed "in range" with what might work, net after applying the new cost metric. Hard numbers were deliberately NOT discussed. The agreement did not seem to be agreeing to an increase which continues over time, but which instead limits itself to a set, smooth increase for X time and then requires a second hard fork if there is agreement on a need for more blocksize at that point. They also talked about leaning towards "if (timestamp &gt; X)" flag day hard fork Y months in the future. A miner advisement was suggested where miners signal non-binding engineering readiness for a hard fork via coinbase moniker. Chat participants are invited to reply to this message with their own corrections and comments and summary in their view. Over the next few months developers and the community should evaluate everything discussed and work towards some concrete proposal(s) that are implemented, tested and simulated in December in Hong Kong.</summary>
