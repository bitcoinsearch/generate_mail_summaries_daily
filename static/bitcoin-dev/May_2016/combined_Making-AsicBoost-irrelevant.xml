    <summary>The design and manufacturing process of ASICs are mostly free from patent restrictions, except for those related to the silicon manufacturing process itself and unpublished patents. However, concerns have been raised by the community regarding the centralization risks posed by ASICs. AsicBoost, an optimization that gives some miners an unfair advantage in perfect competition, could lead to mining monopoly, which would harm the system's decentralization. Some argue that preserving a vulnerability just for the benefit of some miners is not a rational decision for Bitcoin users.Preserving the status quo is not a solution, and alternative solutions need to be explored. One suggestion is to allow blocks to be mined using both the existing PoW algorithm and a slightly tweaked version where implementing AsicBoost gives no advantage. Another proposal is to accept the old POW but with a 20% target penalty. However, patented optimizations give one manufacturer/licenser a significant influence in the market, which poses a risk to the network's health.In a Bitcoin-dev mailing list, an idea was proposed to include a 4-byte hash of the first chunk in the second 64-byte chunk instead of vice versa. All major ASIC manufacturers have made warrants that they are not using AsicBoost, except for the 21 Inc Bitcoin computer. AsicBoost was independently discovered by at least two organizations and is patented, making it necessary to work to hardfork it out. However, changing the block validation ruleset could result in the persistence of two co-existing bitcoin blockchains afterwards.A hard fork has been proposed to fix the version field as a static constant and change the merkle root to become the hash of the real block header. Peter Todd is considering making the patented AsicBoost optimization useless, and hopefully making further similar optimizations useless as well, as part of this hard fork. The proposal would need to be SPV compatible and compatible with existing mining hardware.Tier Nolan explained that AsicBoost requires all data in Chunk 2 to be identical except for the nonce, making finding collisions easier. To make things harder, more of the merkle root could be moved into the second chunk or the timestamp and target could be moved into chunk 1. In any hard fork, this issue should be addressed due to the risks of AsicBoost and the precedent that should be set. Sergio Demian Lerner suggested that instead of changing the protocol, ASIC optimizations should be kept secret, but there is a difference between guaranteed advantage enforced by the legal system and one that is true due to intellectual superiority.</summary>
