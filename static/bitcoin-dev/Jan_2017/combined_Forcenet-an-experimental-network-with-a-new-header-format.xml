    <title>Combined summary - Forcenet: an experimental network with a new header format</title>

    <summary>A new experimental network called Forcenet has been created to show how a new header format could be implemented. The current Bitcoin header is too small and provides insufficient nonce space for ASICs, therefore people are forced to put various data in the coinbase transaction. The header of Forcenet is mostly described in Luke’s BIP, but with some amendments as implemented. In addition to increasing the maximum block size, the calculation and validation of witness commitment may be changed with a new header. As this is a work-in-progress, expect a reset every couple of weeks. To join Forcenet, start with "bitcoind —forcenet".Johnson Lau has created a second version of forcenet with experimental features and stopped his forcenet1 node. The new header format includes Height (4), BIP9 signalling field (4), hardfork signalling field (2), Hash TMR (32), Hash WMR (32), Merkle sum root (32), number of tx (4), prev hash (32), timestamp (4), nBits (4), nonce1 (4), nonce2 (4), nonce3 (compactSize + variable), merkle branches leading to header C (compactSize + 32 bit hashes). Anti-tx-replay feature is added which calculates sighash for both segwit and non-segwit outputs with BIP143, except 0x2000000 is added to the nHashType. Block sighashlimit is counted only for legacy non-segwit inputs (with masked tx nVersion). The sum tree is made as an independent tree with a separate commitment to redefine it with softfork.The weight and sigop count could be transmitted as variable length integers. It would mean that the block format would have to include the raw transaction, "extra"/tree information and witness data for each transaction. On an unrelated note, the two costs could be combined into a unified cost. Signature aggregation will make this a bigger problem as one signature may spend thousands of sigop. Johnson Lau suggests the better way would be making the sum tree as an independent tree with a separate commitment and define a special type of softfork. Adiabat raised some questions about the header of forcenet. Adiabat's first question is related to the variable length fields in the header. Adiabat thinks that it is nicer to have a fixed size rather than variable length fields in the header. Second, he asks if having both TMR and WMR really needed. Johnson Lau foresees that there will be 2 types of headers under this system: the 80 bytes short header and the variable length full header. The height is also committed to in the coinbase tx via BIP34 but Johnson Lau has suggested committing it to the block header itself.Johnson Lau has proposed a second version of forcenet with experimental features. It includes a new header format containing Height, BIP9 signalling field, hardfork signalling field, Hash TMR and WMR, Merkle sum root, number of tx, prev hash, timestamp, nBits, nonce1, nonce2, nonce3, and merkle branches leading to header C. Matt Corallo suggests minimizing header size and using only one merkle tree for transactions hashed in two ways. Lau explains that nBits is needed in the header for PoW checking and suggests that variable-length header fields could be avoided. Corallo questions why merkle branch should be included if the Merkle sum tree is used. Lau suggests that the sum tree lacks flexibility to redefine values with softforks and commits to weight and nSigOp must be equal to or larger than the real value.The developers are discussing changes to the bitcoin protocol in a recent email chain. A proposal has been made to simplify the mining of blocks by removing the coinbase transaction from the new block header and replacing it with the hash of the secondary header. This would save space, without giving up any utility. The format for the hard fork is still being discussed, but it is likely to be a simple hard fork. However, there are concerns regarding firmware upgrades and making sure that light wallets continue to function without upgrade. Another proposal put forward is to create a new way to define tx weight, which would include the maximum of four metrics. There was some discussion that this may make it more complicated to use max() for limits and could complicate coin selection. To address these concerns, the developers suggest that wallets could ignore certain limits in coin selection. In addition, developers propose a smooth halving method, where the reward of the last 2016 blocks in a halving cycle is reduced by 25%, which will be contributed to the first 2016 blocks of the new halving cycle. This is intended to create a more graceful transition, but it is not yet clear if this is necessary. Developers have also proposed a new coinbase tx format, where BIP34 is removed and the Coinbase</summary>
