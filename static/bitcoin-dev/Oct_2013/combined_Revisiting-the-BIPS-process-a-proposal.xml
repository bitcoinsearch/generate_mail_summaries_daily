    <summary>The Bitcoin protocol is open and transparent, which is essential to trusting the system. However, the reference implementation is the specification, and while the "specification" on the wiki provides a set of notes, it is not the real specification. Few people who are familiar with the source code use the wiki. Writing alternate implementations can be hard and dangerous because consistency is more important than correctness. In the long run, if effort is put into accurately describing the rules, it should indeed carry a strong notice about it being descriptive rather than normative. BIPs should help build consensus and review about how to do something and document that consensus. The IETF makes a clear distinction between individual proposals and documents which have been accepted by a working group. The former are named after their authors, and work is not assigned a number until it is complete. The information in the wiki is woefully incomplete, so it is important to exercise RFC 6919 keywords in the Bitcoin protocol RFC.</summary>
