    <summary>In October 2013, Luke-Jr suggested that proposals go through the mailing list first, referring to BIP 1 for the process. A proposal was submitted on the mailing list but received an underwhelming response. Mitar also shared an article about how he failed in contributing to the official Bitcoin project. The article listed several complaints, including not being allowed to edit the Bitcoin wiki and not receiving any answers to his IRC questions about issues on the GitHub page. He also claimed that #bitcoin-dev would rather talk about conspiracies or destroying other cryptocurrencies. Additionally, he stated that Bitcoiners are paranoid, anti-authoritarian nutjobs. On the other hand, some of the long-standing pull requests were created by people with direct commit access. The Bitcoin development community uses a model with a relatively long pipeline, justified by the software's safety criticalness and current shortages of active review. However, there is still a backlog of unsafe changes. Finally, the takeaway from this experience was that the Bitcoin development community needs better introductory materials.</summary>
