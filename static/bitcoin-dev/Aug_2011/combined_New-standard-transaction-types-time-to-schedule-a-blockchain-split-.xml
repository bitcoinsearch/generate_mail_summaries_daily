    <summary>The discussion revolves around the encoding of complex transaction scripts in Bitcoin. The current protocol encodes Bitcoin output script in addresses, but this may change in the future. Gregory Maxwell suggested the creation of an address type that can encode any payment script. However, it was decided to wait for a use case before implementing this idea.Pieter proposed a general scheme on Github that can convert arbitrary expressions over signature-checks given in RPL notation to Bitcoin scripts. Michael Gr√∏nager suggested having usable addresses that encode a couple of escrow destinations and defining an address type that encodes an expression in RPL form. Gavin Andresen emphasized the importance of 3-of-3 (group trust accounts) and testing each use case instead of dropping them.Christian Decker proposed adding an RSA-like scheme for m-out-of-n signatures, but it doesn't solve the problem of malware-infected PCs. Luke-Jr suggested removing hard limits and adjusting difficulty every block based on a rolling window, while Satoshi variable-size fractions were considered batshit insane by Pieter. Multi-signature transactions were discussed as a tool for secure Bitcoin wallets, with some arguing that external private key protectors are also useful. Re-enabling opcodes and adding an OP_BITCOUNT operation could be helpful. Also, proposed standard multi-signature transactions, if accepted, would require new Bitcoin addresses that will be incompatible with old clients. It is suggested to implement or enable opcodes so that the new Bitcoin addresses can be small, schedule a block chain split for N months from now, and support a long N-address address type for multi-sig destinations.Lastly, Mike Hearn questioned the use cases for encoding arbitrary scripts in a user-facing address, suggesting it would be better to define another type of URI for each kind of transaction. A class of scripts that represent boolean expressions over signature checks can be allowed to pass the IsStandard() test, but the main concern is about possible problems associated with accepting them.</summary>
