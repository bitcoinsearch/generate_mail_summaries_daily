    <summary>Bitcoin developer Gavin Andresen has outlined his priorities for the next few months. He plans to focus on network health, chronic problems with new code causing CRITICAL_SECTION deadlocks, wallet security, bug fixing, and testing. One of his main goals is to create trojan-resistant secure wallet solutions by implementing wallet encryption and multisignature patch. However, there are currently inadequate admin guides with little mention of RPC encryptwallet or detailed descriptions of the various states a wallet may be in before and after encryptwallet has been run. Therefore, he believes that the lack of documentation is an issue that needs to be addressed.In terms of testing, Gavin mentions that it is difficult for him to personally test every pull request. Therefore, he will only approve those that have been thoroughly tested. He suggests helping to find money and/or people for a dedicated "core bitcoin quality assurance team". Additionally, he believes that more unit tests and automated testing would be welcome. However, he acknowledges that testing often happens in the periphery by organizations and individuals with an incentive to focus on these issues.There is also a chronic problem with new code causing CRITICAL_SECTION deadlocks, partly due to the locking system. Sipa had begun looking at redoing the locking system to solve this bug by either making everything single-threaded or creating a very careful checking/rework of the locking system. He proposes a system with one lock for the node-handling code, one for the wallet-handling code, and one for network-handling code.Sipa's work on wallet and key export/import is intended for the 0.4 release, but it should be finished by now in terms of functionality, at least for dumpprivkey, importprivkey, and removeprivkey. There is less certainty regarding dumpwallet/importwallet, which may require changes to the json dump format. Finally, there is a need to un-hardcode fee handling, for which Sipa has made some good algorithmic suggestions.Gavin also desires research-y features like "impolite peer" detection/reaction to prevent various DOS/Sybil attacks, better detection/reaction to double spend attempts or block-chain splits, and code for mining pool participants that helps keep mining pool operators honest. He also mentions his desire to see fClient mode and moving from wxWidgets to qt for the GUI.Pieter proposed a reworked fee system for Bitcoin mining where a score is assigned to each transaction group in such a way that scores keep increasing over time, and the memory pool is sorted according to those scores. The lowest-scoring ones are dropped when a configurable memory limit is reached, and for mining, the top N transaction groups from the pool are selected so that an average configurable fee per byte is maintained. Each mining node chooses a cutoff score above which transactions are included, and the network should converge to a fixed probability distribution for the score at which transactions are included. Nodes can measure and estimate this distribution and calculate expected time to inclusion for a given fee. However, defining a scoring system for transactions independent of the current exchange value of bitcoins and mimicking the cost for the network to handle that transaction remains a challenge. Pieter currently doesn't have the time to implement these ideas.</summary>
