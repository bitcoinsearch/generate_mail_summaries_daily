    <summary>Pieter Wuille posted on the bitcoin-dev mailing list proposing an optimal parameter selection for the Golomb Coded Sets that are proposed in BIP158. He found that if we want a false positive rate (FP rate) of exactly 1 in 2^20, the Rice parameter should be 19, not 20. However, if we don't want this FP rate, we should pick an FP rate of 1 in a 1.4971*2^B. For example, M=784931 B=19 or M=1569861 B=20. Gregory Maxwell replied to Pieter's post saying that if the configuration is roughly right, then M=784931 B=19 should be used, as it was a paste error. Another user did a rough analysis using Pieter's approximations on what parameters minimize the total communications for a lite wallet scanning the chain and fetching a witnessless block whenever they get a filter hit. For a wallet with 1000 keys and blocks of 1MB, if the number of entries in the filter is at least 5096, then M=784931 results in a lower total data rate (FP blocks + filters) than M=1569861. The optimal value for the rice parameter 18 is M=392465, which is better if at least 10192 entries are set, and optimal FP for rice 17 is M=196233, which is better if at least 20384 entries are set. The prior filter set proposal sets roughly 13300 entries per full block, and it is estimated that the in+out scripts only ones are setting about 7500 entries. Assuming that all-scripts inputs and outputs (but no txids) are used and that the guess of 7500 bits set for that configuration is roughly right, then M=1569861 and rice parameter 19 should be used. The actual optimal FP rate for total data transferred won't be one that gets the optimal rice coding efficiency, but since different clients will be monitoring for different numbers of keys, it probably makes sense to pick a parameter with optimal compression rather than optimal-data-transfer-for-a-specific-key-count.</summary>
