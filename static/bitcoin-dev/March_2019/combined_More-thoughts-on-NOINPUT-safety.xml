    <title>Combined summary - More thoughts on NOINPUT safety</title>

    <summary>The context revolves around the use of NOINPUT in Bitcoin transactions and the measures taken to ensure its safety. The use of NOINPUT reintroduces the possibility of third-party malleability, which can make the transaction invalid by changing its intermediate states. However, a finish transaction with a NOINPUT implementation and a CSV delay can prevent any problem from arising.Two primary concerns regarding NOINPUT are discussed. Firstly, the signature may apply to an unexpectedly different script, leading to issues when dealing with blacklisted entities. Secondly, someone else could resend money to the same address without the owner's consent, making the second concern more concerning than the first one. To prevent such scenarios, suggestions such as tagging addresses that can be spent via NOINPUT and making signatures non-replayable on different transactions are proposed.The Lightning-dev mailing list covers several topics related to NOINPUT, including adding additional safety measures such as requiring signatures that commit to the input and using OP_CSV or an absolute timelock. The participants express a preference for more safety measures.The issue of lack of OP_CSV in the settlement branch is also discussed. A separate public key is required for the settlement branch to ensure that a settlement signature can only take the settlement branch. The context also describes a setup for a Taproot eltoo channel where two parties can conduct transactions without revealing that the channel is NOINPUT capable.Overall, the discussions aim to ensure the safety and privacy of NOINPUT implementation in Bitcoin transactions while addressing potential issues and risks.</summary>
