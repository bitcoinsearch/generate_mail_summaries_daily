    <summary>In a discussion thread on bitcoin-dev from December 2016, Ethan Heilman raised concerns around the vulnerability of Bitcoind nodes that may not be applying patches, and the possibility of exploiting these outdated nodes. Another issue raised was the partitioning of nodes with versions below MIN_PEER_PROTO_VERSION, which can become vulnerable to eclipse attacks. One proposed solution included still connecting to obsolete nodes while stopping the transmission of full-blocks and transactions, alerting operators that something is wrong and causing them to upgrade. However, some developers argued that anti-features like planned obsolescence would not be effective in free software as they could be easily removed. In response, it was suggested that developers should stop maintaining and giving support for older versions, and users should report bugs to GitHub so they can be fixed. A user named Alice Wonder cited issues with the test suite and errors in the environment as reasons for not upgrading.</summary>
