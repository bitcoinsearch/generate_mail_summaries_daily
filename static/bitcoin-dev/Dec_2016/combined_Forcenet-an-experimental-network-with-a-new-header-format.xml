    <title>Combined summary - Forcenet: an experimental network with a new header format</title>

    <summary>The Bitcoin protocol is the subject of several proposals for a hard fork. The proposals include changes such as limiting transaction size through four different limits, altering the coinbase transaction format to allow more than one input, and introducing a new Merkle sum tree feature that allows fraud-proof for fee and weight, but does not allow proof for spending non-existing UTXOs. A developer has created a second version of forcenet with experimental features, including a new header format. The new header format includes several fields such as Height, BIP9 signalling field, hardfork signalling field, Hash TMR, Hash WMR, Merkle sum root, number of tx, prev hash, timestamp, nBits, nonce1, nonce2, nonce3 and merkle branches leading to header C. Anti-tx-replay is also included, and the block sighashlimit is counted only for legacy non-segwit inputs. The author proposes several changes to the Bitcoin protocol, including using only one Merkel tree for transactions, removing variable-length header fields, and simplifying the transaction Merkel root of the "old-style" header. Additionally, the proposal suggests a smooth halving transition and a new coinbase transaction format. Finally, the author introduces the concept of a Merkel sum tree, which allows generating fraud-proof for fee and weight.The discussion on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list covers various approaches suggested for a hard fork in the Bitcoin network. One approach suggested is a simple hard fork, assuming that the warning system is fixed. Another proposal suggests disabling SPV clients post-fork by keeping the header format compatible with PR#9443 and not caring about the coinbase transaction. The discussion also looks at the Stratum protocol and the issue of keeping existing light wallets functioning without upgrade. There is some debate about whether the proposal to define tx weight based on the maximum of four metrics is too complicated and could make coin selection difficult.Matt Corallo suggests minimizing the header size and using only one merkle tree for transactions hashed without witnesses and only witnesses. He proposes that the transaction merkle root of the old-style header should be the hash of the new header. The proposal also includes a new way to define tx weight which is the maximum of SigHashSize metrics. A special softfork (bit 15) will be defined which disables the validation of the sum tree in full node.The hard fork activation method is based on block height. Blocks with a height that is a multiple of 2016 will trigger bit15, which relates to the Merkle sum tree. Blocks with a height that is a multiple of 4032 will trigger bit16, which relates to block weight. The rationale behind choosing the maximum of the different metrics for tx weight is that it creates an upper block resource limit for every metric while making tx fee estimation linear. To join Forcenet, codes are available on Github, and users can start with "bitcoind â€”forcenet". Connection can be made through a node run by the creator at 8333.info with default port (38901). Mining is supported, but limited GBT support is theoretically possible. New RPC commands include getlegacyblock and getlegacyblockheader, which generate blocks and headers that are compatible with legacy nodes. This is largely work-in-progress so expect a reset every couple weeks.</summary>
