    <summary>The Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) process is intended to provide a platform for individuals in the Bitcoin development community to place specifications that may be important for others to see, ensuring interoperability. The BIP editor's role is to encourage BIP authors to respond to feedback on their proposals and format them in a standard form. The editor should not take a position on substantive changes to the contents of a BIP; it is up to the author(s) of a BIP to decide. If there are any objections to adding a new BIP editor, a process BIP can be opened, but this is unnecessary according to prior precedent. The BIP repository is not critical in this instance, as proposed protocol documents can be placed nearly anywhere with the same effect. Luke Dashjr, a BIP editor, has been accused of deliberately refusing to accept changes that the author approves, leading to the failure of the BIP process. Dashjr claims that he is triaging BIPs PRs neutrally according to the currently-defined BIP process, which he has always done. However, there are some bad actors trying to misportray the BIPs as an approval process so they can pretend ST is somehow official or that the preexisting Core+Taproot client is "breaking" the spec. These actors have been harassing Dashjr demanding special treatment. He will not become an accomplice to this deception by giving special treatment, although he has made two efforts to make things faster, which have been obstructed by ST advocates.</summary>
