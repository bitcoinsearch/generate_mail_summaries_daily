    <summary>The Bitcoin community is anticipating the release of the Taproot upgrade around May 1st. The activation of this upgrade is planned for November 15th. Discussions have been held to determine the best signaling period for the upgrade, with block 683424 being the first and block 695520 being the stop height if choosing heights. Alternatively, a mid-period MTP target of 1300 UTC on May 7th and a stop time of 1300 UTC on August 13th were suggested if choosing times.During the discussions, the LOT=true proposal was also evaluated, with some members suggesting better economic majority measurement tools are required. Others argued that existing futures and chain split tokens provide reasonable signals. In an email thread between Rusty Russell and Matt, they agreed that avoiding multiple active chains is crucial during Taproot activation. ST was not intended as a solution for Taproot activation but could be useful as a follow-up if miners cannot upgrade before its signaling window expires.The possibility of chain splits was also discussed, with an emphasis on establishing developer and user consensus to avoid them. Rusty suggested tracking cumulative work on invalid chains for bitcoind, while Matt proposed a better approach to dealing with the possibility of miners not upgrading quickly. It was emphasized that Bitcoin users are the ultimate decider, and contingency planning should be deemed important rather than brinkmanship.</summary>
