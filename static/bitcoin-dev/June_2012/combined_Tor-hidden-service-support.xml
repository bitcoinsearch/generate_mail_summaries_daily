    <summary>The mainline of the Tor hidden service support has been merged a few days ago, allowing for the possibility to run a hidden service bitcoin node and connect to other bitcoin hidden services with the use of a Tor proxy when running git HEAD. The 0.7 release is expected to include this feature. Furthermore, these addresses are also exchanged and relayed through the P2P network. The fd87:d87e:eb43::/48 IPv6 range has been reused to map each address in the 80-bit range to an onion address which belongs to a separate network. This same network range is part of the RFC4193 Unique Local IPv6 range and is normally not globally routable. For other clients that wish to implement similar functionality, they can use the test case 5wyqrzbvrdsumnok.onion == FD87:D87E:EB43:edb1:8e4:3588:e546:35ca. The conversion is simply decoding the base32 onion address and storing the resulting 80 bits of data as low-order bits of an IPv6 address prefixed by fd87:d87e:eb43:. As this range is not routable, there should be no compatibility issues among unaware IPv6-capable codes.Pieter emphasizes that the bitcoin's hidden service support is not OnionCat and does not use OnionCat in any way, even though it uses a compatible IPv6 mapping with OnionCat. The advertisement style is used because the protocol already relays IPv6 addresses to regular Tor hidden service connections, rather than the more risky and low-performance IP in TCP OnionCat stuff. Grarpamp suggests adding blocks to the IsRoutable check to allow people who use overlay networks with private space to add relevant blocks easily. Pieter notes that while these blocks are not expected to be routable, people may have interfaces, routing tables, and packet filters on their machines configured with up to all three of those networks for the purposes therein.</summary>
