    <summary>In this conversation, grarpamp is asking about the difference between two repositories, bitcoin/bitcoin and bitcoin/bitcoind-stable. The latter is Luke's backports of security and stability fixes to otherwise unmaintained old versions. Grarpamp asks if the github/0.6.2 branch is safe for production and what degree of caution should be used when using github/master. A cautionary approach is advised when running master on wallets with large amounts of non-testnet coin in them because there have been bugs that would corrupt wallets and burn coins in mining and transactions. Testnet exists so people can test without fear of losing a lot of funds. It would be helpful if anyone offering bitcoin services would set up parallel toy versions of their sites on testnet. Grarpamp also requests to fix the issue where detachdb isn't inside the ifdef in bitcoin git master.</summary>
