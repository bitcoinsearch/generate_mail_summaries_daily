    <summary>The growth of the Bitcoin network has surpassed Satoshi's expectations, leading to scalability issues that need to be addressed. One suggestion is to require a cumulative fee for transactions before they can be accepted in blocks, but this idea has been frequently suggested and dismantled on Bitcointalk forums. Making the block size limit float has also been proposed as a solution, but it comes with non-trivial existential risk. Increasing scalability without breaking decentralization is challenging, but achievable. The goal should be "as much as possible" decentralization, achieved by having more cheaply operated nodes with a distribution of ownership and interest. However, maintaining expensive validation infrastructure can only be justified if there is an intention to manipulate or prevent manipulation of the currency, which could lead to a tragedy of the commons. The alternative of an autonomous and decentralized system, even if transactions are somewhat slow or costly, would provide excellent competition for everything else.In a discussion about scalability and SatoshiDice, it was agreed that it is desirable for senders/buyers to pay no fees, but eventually, someone will have to pay. The idea of de-ranking transactions that re-use addresses was not favored as Bitcoin already has a good way of prioritizing transactions via the fees mechanism. The issue is that SatoshiDice generates a lot of transactions, which pushes traditional traffic out due to artificial throttles. The article discusses various proposals to improve Bitcoin's functionality and address the current situation. One proposal is to limit the reuse of addresses, which can be achieved by limiting the count of address reuses in memory pool. This will give nodes across the network some say in the transactions they have to deal with, instead of relying on miners to make decisions that are good for total network load but worse for them. Another proposal suggests changing the mining code to group transactions together with their mempool dependencies and calculating all fees as a group. This allows a transition to a "receiver pays" model for fees and avoids angry users who want to buy things but don't know what fee to set, causing their transactions to get stuck.SatoshiDice should use the same fee algorithms as Bitcoin-Qt to avoid paying excessive fees and queue-jumping, while scalability improvements seem like a no-brainer to everyone. Making the block size limit float is better than picking a new arbitrary threshold, which is definitely something appealing as Bitcoin needs to scale up. The article also touches upon the topic of blockchain pruning, which is still a matter of careful consideration due to its overall effects across the network.Lastly, the article mentions that SPV clients like MultiBit and Android Wallet already exist and will get better with time, and if Jeff implements the bloom filtering p2p commands, it will knock out excessive bandwidth usage and parse overheads from end-users who are on these clients. Overall, the proposals discussed aim to improve Bitcoin's functionality and address the current situation.</summary>
