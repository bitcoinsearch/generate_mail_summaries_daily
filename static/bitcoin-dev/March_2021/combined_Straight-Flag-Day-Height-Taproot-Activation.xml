    <summary>The Bitcoin community is currently discussing the best approach to activate Taproot, with the focus on maintaining consensus. There is significant debate around the activation method for the proposed Taproot soft fork, with many individuals committing themselves to running incompatible consensus rules. This could potentially harm the network more than any soft-fork does good and delays the release of a future Taproot activation.One way to keep the network in consensus would be to activate Taproot through a traditional, no-frills, flag-day (or -height) activation with a flag day of roughly August 2022. Matt Corallo, a Bitcoin Core developer, has suggested implementing a flag day activation instead of any BIP8-based activation for the Taproot upgrade. He argues that forced-signaling or any form of signaling does not materially change whether a soft fork can be seen to be safe to use, and that having a broad set of upgraded nodes across the network, including an overwhelming majority of economically-active nodes, enforcing the rules of a new fork is more important. Additionally, he believes that a fixed activation date may be superior for business purposes, software engineering schedules, etc.There is debate about whether a user-activated fork is necessary to remove miners' influence over consensus rules entirely. Some advocate for lockinontimeout=true immediately, while others argue that BIP8 is well-designed for case 1 where users can override miner objections if they object for bad reasons. However, BIP8 *encourages* a consensus split if good reasons for not activating are discovered afterwards, so it may not be well-suited for case 2.The email thread discusses various approaches to activate Taproot and the potential risks associated with each approach. The "speedy trial" approach is favored, which involves miners signaling for a certain period before activation without consensus-level effect. A lot=true variant would require enforcing signaling prior to the end of July, which is an unreasonable timeframe to expect most economic nodes to upgrade in; if bip9 is used, then the risk of enforcement occurring with minority hashrate would also make a bip148/lot=true variant difficult.The high node-level adoption bar is one of the most critical goals, and the one most currently in jeopardy in a BIP 8 approach. SPV mining has been curtailed somewhat to only apply for a brief period of time since the last time SPV mining caused a fork. Ultimately, someone has to take an active, malicious action in order to mine a bad block, versus with forced signaling, someone only needs to forget to reconfigure one out of one hundred pool servers they own.Matt Corallo and Jeremy Rubin discussed the potential risks of miners generating invalid blocks due to SPV mining. They also discussed the use of mandatory signaling versus a Taproot flag day, with Matt noting that mandatory signaling would result in any miner who has not taken active action generating invalid blocks. The discussion also touched on the use of BIP8 and early activation, with Jeremy suggesting that a fixed activation date may be superior for business purposes and software engineering schedules.Overall, the community must balance the desire for early activation with the need for consensus and network stability. It is suggested that updating getblocktemplate so that miners signal uptake for something like three or four retarget periods prior to activation, without that signaling having any consensus-level effect, could help miners and businesses adjust their expectations for how much hashpower might not be enforcing Taproot rules when generating blocks. The email thread also suggests that more outreach may be necessary to ensure broad community consensus for activation and that Matt's proposed approach is both better and simpler to avoid giving miners undue influence on consensus.</summary>
