    <summary>The Bitcoin community is currently divided on how to activate the Taproot upgrade. One concern is the potential for chain splits if both lot=false and lot=true nodes are active at the same time. Some members of the community suggest a "speedy trial" approach, allowing for fast activation via miner enforcement prior to everyone upgrading. This method would not allow a minority of hashpower to block activation and would provide markets with a single signaling period to focus on.However, there are concerns about users pushing for a UASF-style forced-signaling guerrilla faster-activation similar to what happened with BIP 148/UASF. This approach could be vulnerable to social media attacks, and the responsibility lies with the majority of users who may not be aware of the debate.While the BIP8 LOT=false method is considered reasonably safe, divergent consensus rules on the network must be avoided. To address this issue, the Bitcoin community is considering the activation of Taproot through a Flag Day activation, choosing a block height after which the new Taproot rules would become enforced. This approach would take less time than other methods and eliminate the risk of a chain split from forced signaling.Supporters of the permissionless "users rule" approach of LOT=true would be happy as it takes miners out of activation, while supporters of the safe, conservative approach of LOT=false can be made happy by setting the flag day far in the future or derisking in other ways. If the Core developer team was ever co-opted and used the flag day method maliciously, the bitcoin user community could create their own counter-soft-fork full node with no censorship rules. Without miner signaling, wallets backed by full nodes enforce Bitcoin's rules. Ultimately, some group needs to make a decision on how to activate Taproot, and the Bitcoin economy and users will be asked for their opinions on flag day activation. It is important to reinforce the idea that consensus rule diversity runs the risk of consensus failure.</summary>
