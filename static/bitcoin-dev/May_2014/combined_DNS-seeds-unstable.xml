    <summary>In May 2014, Andreas Schildbach brought up the issue of Bitcoin DNS seeds infrastructure being unstable due to using a custom DNS implementation that may not be 100% compatible. He suggested that DNS seeds should only be used as fast connectivity hints primarily for initial connectivity and relying on them exclusively increases isolation vulnerabilities. In response, Matt Corallo requested more information on when the test was run and if anyone else could reproduce it. On May 16, 2014, Laszlo Hanyecz reported an issue with testnet-seed.bluematt.me and provided a trace of the domain's aliases and addresses. Corallo missed that this was the testnet seed and explained that it never got set up properly and was just pointing to a static seed node that was down but the mainnet seed actually works.</summary>
