    <summary>The email conversation on Bitcoin network privacy and security describes the attack where a NATed client connects to the Bitcoin network through 8 entry peers, which allows an attacker to make the mapping. For each neighbor, a Bitcoin peer keeps the history of addresses that it forwarded to the neighbor. If an address was already forwarded to a neighbor, it is not retransmitted again. The implementation of connection rotation would be fine for improving a node's knowledge about available peers and making the network stronger against partitioning. However, Gregory Maxwell thinks the motivation is opposite the behavior. If you keep a constant set of outbound peers, only those peers learn the origin of your transactions, and so it is unlikely that any particular attacker will gain strong evidence. Ultimately, since the traffic is clear text, if you expect to have any privacy at all in your broadcasts, you should be broadcasting over tor or i2p.</summary>
