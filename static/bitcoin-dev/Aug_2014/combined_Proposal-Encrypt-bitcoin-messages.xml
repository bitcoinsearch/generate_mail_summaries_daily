    <summary>In an email exchange on August 19, 2014, Justus Ranvier questioned the debate over deprecating HTTP and other unencrypted transport methods. While he thinks it's desirable, Ranvier believes that engineering is full of tradeoffs and that the ones involved here don't make it a high priority, especially since people should be using Bitcoin over Tor, which provides better privacy and covers encrypt + auth. Authentication is more important than encryption, in his opinion, because authentication is required for a number of anti-partitioning-attack measures. He previously thought that opportunistic encryption was a little work once authenticating, but it should be the authentication that drives that kind of effort.Ranvier also suggested using TLS with self-signed certificates as an improvement if it's not acceptable to use unencrypted transport methods. However, TLS is a large complex attack surface and any use of it requires an additional dependency with a significant amount of difficult-to-audit code. Ranvier noted that TLS is easily DOS attacked and every widely-used TLS implementation has had multiple memory disclosure or remote execution vulnerabilities in just the last few years. By not having TLS, the Bitcoin community has avoided several emergency scale vulnerabilities.</summary>
