    <summary>Bitcoin developers are currently discussing the possibility of changing the checksum for v1+ unconditionally due to a weakness in the Bech32 checksum algorithm used in BIP173. The change would ensure that all wallets can handle v1+ BIP173 addresses correctly. While some concern has been raised about the compatibility of old software with the new checksum, the change is considered to be fairly trivial compared to other proposed changes.Two proposals have been put forward to address the issue of forward compatibility with witness v1 addresses. The first proposal suggests using length restrictions for future segwits, which would be backwards compatible but may require new encoding. The second proposal suggests changing the checksum based on the first byte, which would be backwards incompatible but weaken guarantees against typos in the first two data-part letters to 1 in a billion. A decision needs to be made soon to avoid future complications.Developers are also considering the use of length limits, although some are opposed to consensus-invalidating certain length/version combinations and prefer not to commit to restrictions on future addresses. Additionally, a proposal has been made to use a variant of the checksum scheme suggested by Pieter Wuille, which uses constant M = 0x3FFFFFFF, but this has been deemed suboptimal in some ways.The bitcoin-dev mailing list has also been discussing whether to maintain the property that old software can send coins to future SegWit versions. Pieter Wuille suggests that given the failures seen in testing, there is no reason to maintain this property. He proposes changing the checksum for v1+ unconditionally, which also protects old senders from an insertion issue. Using the constant M=0x2bc830a3 instead of 0x3fffffff is suggested and more information can be found on Wuille's gist. The discussion also covers other topics such as error detection properties and the likelihood of software upgrades.</summary>
