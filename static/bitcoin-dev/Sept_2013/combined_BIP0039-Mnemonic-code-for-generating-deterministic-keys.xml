    <summary>The discussion thread begins with Mark Friedenbach warning against the danger of getting things wrong. The conversation then turns towards Wikipedia's issue with images not displaying for some users due to addons that block certain URLs containing cryptographic hashes. Matthew Mitchell expresses concern over potentially offensive words in the wordlist, and suggests using nouns instead as they tend to be more neutral. Pavol Rusnak revisits the wordlist and replaces around 67 words that could be offensive in some context. Slush announces that they have removed many theoretically offensive words from the BIP39 wordlist and implemented an algorithm for detecting words with similar characters and resolving duplicates. They have also added password protection and seed hardening using Rijndael cipher, which allows users to generate different BIP32 wallets by using the mnemonic with different passwords. Slush asks for constructive comments on their solution as it is intended to be used in Trezor and other wallet clients. The thread ends with a link to Intel's webinars on accelerating application performance.</summary>
