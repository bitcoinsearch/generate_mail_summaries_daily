    <summary>MultiBit is a Bitcoin wallet that supports several languages, including German, Spanish, and Greek. Bitcoin-qt, another Bitcoin wallet, also supports a broad set of languages. It is suggested that language codes be added to each entry, as well as operating system support. However, all versions of these wallets are available for Windows, Mac, and Linux.It is not clear which computer would have an initial start time of 24 hours or more. In normal systems, initial sync-up takes only a few hours. Slow syncing may occur if peers are unresponsive, but this can also affect SPV nodes. While it's better to be conservative, calling it a dozen times longer than expected might be too much. Therefore, refining the information is necessary.</summary>
