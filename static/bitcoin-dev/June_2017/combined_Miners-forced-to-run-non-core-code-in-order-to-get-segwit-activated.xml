    <summary>The debate around Segwit2x/BIP91/BIP148 has continued in the Bitcoin community, with concerns raised about orphaning miners that do not run a Segwit2x or BIP148 node. All versions of Bitcoin Core since 0.13.1 signal segwit and even 0.14.1+ signal it when downstream mining software doesn't support it. However, there is no specification of the behavior so it's unclear what exactly would need to be implemented to be consistent. Miners can continue signaling segwit, which will leave them at least soft-fork compatible with BIP148 and BIP91. There are concerns that some miners may start orphaning their own blocks because they are failing to signal segwit. The rejection of segwit2x from Bitcoin's developers seems to be resolute, with a strong correlation with people who are unwilling and unable to keep updating the software at an acceptable level of quality. Concerns have also been raised that if miners interpret the situation as being forced to run non-reference software to prevent a chain split due to lack of support from Bitcoin Core, it could lead to a one-way street. While miners have the option to create an altcoin, all those things (148/91/segwit2x(per today)) effectively guarantee a chainsplit.</summary>
