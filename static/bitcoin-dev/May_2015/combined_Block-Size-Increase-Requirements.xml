    <summary>Matt Corallo, a Bitcoin developer, has expressed his concerns about committing to a blocksize increase. He believes that several issues need to be resolved before he would consider supporting the commitment. The proposals to decrease block propagation latency should be addressed, and there should be better scaling technology and conclusions to the discussion around long-term incentives within the system. There have been discussions regarding miners optimizing for returns, which could lead to half of the network being optimized away. Gavin Andresen, another Bitcoin pioneer, argues that the incentives are not aligned and good-behavior models are far from convincing. An individual miner might create larger blocks which fork off miners in other parts of the world to get more income. This issue is small with 1 MB blocks, but it will worsen with 20 MB blocks and needs simulation and study. Andresen suggests doubling the block size every couple of years until transaction fees become an essential source of revenue for miners.However, Matt Corallo argues that increasing the blocksize would cause the incentives to make Bitcoin scale to go away. Even if amazing technologies get built, no one will have any reason to use them. Moreover, he claims that if the blocksize is increased such that transaction fees are not the way in which miners make their money, then either miners are not being funded or only people mining/funding miners are large organizations who are "running" Bitcoin. This would result in centralization, which goes against the decentralized nature of Bitcoin.Andresen responds by saying that even if we end up in a world where only big companies can run full nodes, there is a difference - you don't need permission to "open up a bank" on the Bitcoin network. The issue of transaction fees has also been raised. If the block size is increased enough so that transaction fees are not how miners make their money, then either miners are not being funded or only large organizations are funding them. This will lead to centralization, which goes against the decentralized nature of Bitcoin.</summary>
