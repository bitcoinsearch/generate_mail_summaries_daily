    <summary>Pieter Wuille expressed that he would not modify his node if the change introduced a perpetual 100 BTC subsidy per block, even if 99% of miners went along with it. He believes that a hardfork is safe only when 100% of economically relevant users upgrade and that if miners don't upgrade at that point, they just lose money. Pieter explains why a hashrate-triggered hardfork does not make sense, stating that either one believes everyone will upgrade anyway, and the hashrate doesn't matter, or one is not certain, and the fork is risky, independent of what hashrate upgrades. The March 2013 fork showed that miners upgraded at a different schedule than the rest of the network. Roy Badami replied to Pieter's statement saying that if the consensus rules required a 99% supermajority of miners for the hard fork to go ahead, then there would be absolutely no rational reason for merchants and users to refuse to upgrade, even if they do not support the changes introduced by the hard fork. Their only choice, if the fork succeeds, is between the active chain and the one that is effectively stalled. However, Roy questions if such a scenario is plausible. Both Pieter and Roy agree that modifying a node is dependent on the majority of economically relevant users upgrading. Any change that is not accepted by the majority of users can result in the death of Bitcoin.</summary>
