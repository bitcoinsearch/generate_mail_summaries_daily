    <summary>The discussion revolves around the malleability of bitcoin transactions. The idea of allowing the contents of blocks to change (other than by mining a competing chain) would be a significant change to Bitcoin's design. One aspect of this is the requirement that inputs cannot be replaced once included in a transaction, which some argue limits flexibility and creates unnecessary complexity. However, others argue that changing an input would alter the terms of a real-world deal or transaction, which could have consequences. For example, if one party were to replace another in a multi-input transaction, they would gain control of the entire transaction, possibly leading to unfair outcomes. Additionally, the malleability of signatures makes it unreliable to depend on the signature content of a transaction until it has been buried, regardless. An inability to replace an input means that you could not RBF for additional fees without taking change in more cases. There ought to be a benefit to that. In the case of Armory simulfunding, parties could replace one signer's input after they broadcast it. This could lead to confusion about who controls the transaction, and where the funds are coming from, as well as the speed at which the transaction is confirmed, affecting the business. The discussion also touches upon Kalle's Proof of Payment proposed standard, which allows one payer in a two-input transaction to decide to boot the other, and claim the concert tickets all for himself. The fact that he pays is not the only consideration in the real world; what if these are the last 2 tickets? The argument is made that changing how an input is signed does not change the deal, but this is countered with the idea that changing the input set does not change the weeblix. Overall, while there are arguments for and against the ability to replace inputs in bitcoin transactions, there seem to be concerns about the real-world implications of such a change. The malleability of signatures and the potential for unfair outcomes in multi-input transactions are just a few examples of why some argue against allowing this type of change.</summary>
