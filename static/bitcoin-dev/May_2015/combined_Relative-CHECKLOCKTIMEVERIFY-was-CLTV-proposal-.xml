    <summary>Peter Todd's proposal to add CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY as a new opcode in the Bitcoin scripting system aims to solve the problem of proving that transaction outputs cannot be spent until some time in the future. The opcode has various use cases, including escrow, non-interactive time-locked refunds, and two-factor wallets.However, adding such an operation has two major drawbacks. Firstly, more transaction information is exposed inside the script, and secondly, it makes it harder to enforce Bitcoin Core's mempool invariant during reorgs. Additionally, there are discussions on the bitcoin-development mailing list about proposals for requiring locktime-is-at-least-N-plus-the-height-of-my-input instead of locktime-is-at-least-N, which would be useful for building some CLTV-based contracts. There are two proposals - RCLTV against nLockTime and RCLTV against the current block height/time - but both have drawbacks.Despite the drawbacks of adding CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY, the opcode has several practical applications. For example, users can spend their funds without the cooperation of a service by waiting for the expiry time to be reached. This technology is useful for micropayment channels, where a refund transaction is created to ensure that if the payee vanishes, the payor can get their deposit back. Using the same scriptPubKey from the two-factor wallets example solves both these issues.Furthermore, CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY can be used to create outputs that are provably spendable by anyone but only at a time sufficiently far into the future that large miners profitably can't sell the sacrifices at a discount. It can also be used to prove sacrifices of coins to mining fees, which has been proposed as a 'universal public good' to which the sacrifice could be directed, rather than simply destroying the coins.In conclusion, while the addition of CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY has its drawbacks, its practical applications make it a valuable tool for time-based smart contracts in Bitcoin.</summary>
