    <summary>In a discussion thread, Mike Hearn shared an article he had written that explains the hashing assurance contract concept. He pointed out that the prior assurance contract proposals pay miners who mine a chain supportive of your interests and miners who mine against your interests identically. There is already a mechanism built into Bitcoin for paying for security which mitigates the common action problem of people just sitting around for other people to pay for security: transaction fees. Fixing the problem with assurance contracts effectively makes them end up working like transaction fees in any case. However, considering the near-failure in just keeping development funded, it's unclear where the belief that this model will be workable comes from; in particular, unlike a lighthouse (but like development), security is ongoing and not primarily a fixed one-time cost. Mike also reminded people that mining per-contract is a long-identified existential risk to Bitcoin which has been seeing more analysis lately. Aaron Voisine argued that increasing the block size is the safe, conservative course because there is $3 billion plus of value in the system to defend. Pieter Wuille replied by saying that suggesting a hard fork is betting the survival of the entire ecosystem on the bet that everyone will agree with and upgrade to new suggested software before a flag date. He recommended that the fork take effect when some specific large supermajority of the previous 1000 blocks indicate they have upgraded, as a safer alternative to a simple flag date, but pointed out that only measuring miner adoption is the least relevant. The question is whether people using full nodes will upgrade.</summary>
