    <summary>The issue of increasing the maximum block size in Bitcoin has been a topic of debate among the community. Some argue for an increase, while others believe that blocks should remain relatively full to maintain fee pressure. However, concerns have been raised about the ecosystem's focus on building centralized platforms and advocating for changes to Bitcoin that maintain the status quo.To address this issue, many believe that consensus from various technical communities is necessary before presenting any fork to the public. While some argue that more research and software development are needed, others believe that the current system can support at least 1MB blocks roughly every 10 minutes for the next eleven years without requiring an increase. Nonetheless, the issue remains controversial and contentious.Pieter Wuille, one of the core developers of Bitcoin, expressed concern about increasing the maximum block size. He believes that an optimal block size is necessary to balance the scalability of transactions and verifiability of the system. Wuille stresses the importance of using a full node for validating personal or business transactions, which empowers users to use a financial system requiring less trust in anyone. He advises that if miners are given the feedback to determine an optimal block size, they will demand larger blocks for better connected hash power, but if limitations are put in place, like a block size limit, then miners won't have this ability.Bitcoin's long-term mining incentives also pose a concern due to security risks that arise when subsidies fall below fees. An effective scarcity of capacity is essential for fee income to fund autonomous, anonymous, decentralized miners profitably applying enough hash-power to make reorganizations infeasible. However, this may lead to centralization and undermine the openness of the system. The mining ecosystem has become centralized over time, causing a latent undermining of the security model.Matt Corallo, a Bitcoin Core developer, has expressed his concerns regarding the scalability of the currency. According to Corallo, most indicators have been moving in the wrong direction since 2012 when full blocks began to increase, leading to the Blockchain size increasing as well. As a result, he believes that a decrease in the block size limit below the current 300k/txn/day level is necessary. However, this is not an acceptable solution, so instead, many people have been working on increasing the scalability of Bitcoin Core.Corallo acknowledges that the community needs to have a technical discussion about whether it is sane to recommend a given course of action by releasing software which makes it happen. He adds that the ecosystem as a whole continues to focus on building centralized platforms and advocate for changes to Bitcoin which allow them to maintain the status quo. Corallo also discusses the idea that miners could coordinate to adjust the block size if they could specify the maximum block size in their block headers. However, giving miners free rule to do anything they like with their blocks would allow them to do any number of crazy attacks; therefore, the hard block size limit is necessary to keep the network running in a decentralized manner.</summary>
