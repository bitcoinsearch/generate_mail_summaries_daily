    <summary>Miners are not concerned about the age of a UTXO entry, except in two specific cases. One of these is the free transaction policy, which reserves a small portion of block space for transactions that do not pay sufficient fees. These transactions must meet certain priority requirements, such as being of sufficient age, and consume another scarce resource. The other case is that Coinbase transaction outputs can only be spent after 100 confirmations to prevent random reorganisations from invalidating transactions. Wallets select more confirmed outputs first to consume. Bitcoin Wallet selects UTXOs by age to maximize priority while keeping the number of UTXOs low. Jim Phillips suggests dealing with UTXO growth at the source of the problem by designing wallets to consolidate unspent outputs. By selecting all UTXOs from a particular address or wallet and sending the remainder back to the same address or a change address as a single output, the UTXO database could shrink over time instead of growing with each transaction. This could limit the growth of the UTXO database, especially since most users run one of a handful of different wallet apps. Miners could benefit from this method as it reduces the amount of storage dedicated to holding the UTXO. Relays could enforce this behavior by refusing to relay or deprioritizing transactions that don't use all available UTXOs from inputs. It's a complex trade-off as using more UTXOs requires larger transactions and results in more linkage between coins/addresses used, reducing privacy. The only way to guarantee an economical reason to keep the UTXO set small is to have a consensus rule that punishes increasing its size.</summary>
