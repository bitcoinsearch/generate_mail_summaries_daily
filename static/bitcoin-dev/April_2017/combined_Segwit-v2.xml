    <summary>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Luke Dashjr suggested making some minor tweaks to BIP 141's version bit assignment for the next deployment. The first change would be to use 0xFF instead of 0 for the dummy marker in order to avoid ambiguity with incomplete zero-input transactions. The second change would relax the consensus rules on when witness data is allowed for an input, allowing it with any scriptPubKey and in combination with scriptSig. Johnson Lau preferred to keep the dummy marker and not change the commitment structure, while suggesting that scriptSig should be empty as it should be obsoleted. However, Dashjr stated that scriptSig can do things that witness cannot, such as adding additional conditions under the signature, and that he will make a proposal to Litecoin soon which allows signing and executing extra scripts in witness. Finally, Dashjr did not see any benefit in restricting witness to IsPushOnly() scriptPubKey, as miners can already malleate transactions and add garbage to blocks.</summary>
