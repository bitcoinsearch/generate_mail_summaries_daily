    <summary>Bitcoin Core developers Greg Maxwell and Pieter Wuille have both expressed their opposition to the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 148 (BIP148), a user-activated soft fork (UASF) proposal aimed at activating Segregated Witness (SegWit). Maxwell believes that BIP148 is "ill-conceived" and risks forking from segwit-enabled software clients in the short term, adding that there is no need to orphan non-signalling blocks. Instead, he advocates for seeking segwit activation in a way that doesn't fork from older software or just setting a flag day activation of segwit.Wuille shares similar concerns about the potential impact of BIP148 on the network and believes that there are less disruptive options available for activating SegWit. Both developers emphasise the importance of ensuring Bitcoin's stability and reputation for years to come.The Bitcoin community is split over the best approach to activating SegWit and improving scalability. The proposed UASF by BIP148 has been criticised for being too disruptive and forcing orphaning of passive participants. In response, a new proposal called BIP8 has been suggested as a more measured approach that could gain consensus within the community. The debate continues to evolve on the bitcoin-dev mailing list.Supporters of BIP148 argue that it would force miners to activate SegWit, allowing faster and cheaper transactions on the network. Critics argue that it could lead to a chain split and create unnecessary risks for users. Some prominent Bitcoin developers, including Gregory Maxwell and Blockstream CEO Adam Back, have come out against the proposal. Meanwhile, supporters of BIP148 are urging the community to unite behind the proposal and push for its adoption, arguing that it is the best way to move forward with scaling Bitcoin.</summary>
