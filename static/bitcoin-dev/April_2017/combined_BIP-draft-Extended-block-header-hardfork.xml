    <summary>The proposed BIP outlines a hardfork called "spoonnet" that incorporates several requested features. These include deterministic activation logic, strong and simple 2-way replay protection, wipe-out protection, and predictable resource use. However, obtaining community-wide consensus on-chain is difficult, so activation will be based purely on a flag day when the vast majority agree off-chain. The consensus codes for this implementation can be found on GitHub.The extended block header format is proposed through a hardfork to provide a flexible header format that is easily upgradeable with softforks. It is also compatible with the Stratum mining protocol, has a deterministic hardfork activation, and is a permanent hardfork. Currently, the Bitcoin protocol has the block header fixed at 80 bytes with no space reserved for additional data, which is not ideal for light clients. The extended block header format includes several rules that are activated when the median timestamp of the past 11 blocks is equal to or greater than a to-be-determined time and after activation of BIP65. These rules include segregated witness being enabled, the witness of the first input of the coinbase transaction having exactly one stack item (the "extended header"), and additional data included in bytes 0 to 137 of the extended header. The size of the extended header must be at least 138 bytes, and the wtxid of the coinbase transaction is calculated as if the witness of its first input is empty.A special extheader softfork is defined until it is activated, with enforced extra rules. After activation, supporting nodes will not accept blocks mined in old rules. The proposed hardfork change to Bitcoin employs a flag day deployment based on the median timestamp of previous blocks. This ensures a deterministic and permanent departure with the original rules, using the witness field of the coinbase input as a convenient unused space to store the extended header. The extended header size must not be larger than 152 bytes.The extheader softfork is independent of the activation time of the hardfork. If the special softfork is activated before the hardfork, the extra rules will not be enforced when the hardfork is activated. The reserved space (16 bytes until the extheader softfork is activated) must not be used without community consensus. It should be primarily used for consensus critical commitments and network status data for light nodes. Other arbitrary data should use the extra data field in the extended header or the scriptSig of the coinbase transaction.It is important to note that the proposed changes would break compatibility with old full node and light node. The reference implementation for this proposal can be found on GitHub, and the BIP is licensed under the 2-clause BSD license.</summary>
