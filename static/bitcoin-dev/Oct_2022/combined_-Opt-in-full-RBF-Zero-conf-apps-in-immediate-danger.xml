    <summary>The Bitcoin-dev email thread revolves around the potential risks of accepting bitcoin payments, including foreign exchange risk and the ease of canceling transactions in wallets. The discussion also centers on the implementation of full RBF (Replace-by-Fee) on the Bitcoin network and its impact on zero-conf (zero-confirmation) transactions. Some members argue that this feature could pose a risk to businesses accepting zeroconf transactions, while others believe it's an important step towards the adoption of full RBF on the network.There are three fundamental approaches to this issue. The first approach involves continuing support and encouragement of accepting unconfirmed "on-chain" payments indefinitely. The second approach suggests drawing a line in the sand now but giving people who are currently accepting unconfirmed txs time to update their software and business model. The third approach suggests encouraging mainnet miners and relay nodes to support unconditional RBF immediately. However, some contributors argue that this approach is disingenuous without clearly warning people of the risks involved.The CEO of GAP600, a company that guarantees zero confirmed Bitcoin and other crypto transactions, expresses concern about the impact of RBF becoming default enabled and significantly adopted on their capacity to accept zero-conf transactions on mainnet. Statistics from GAP600 reveal that they have processed around 15 million transactions with a cumulative value of USD 2.3 billion as of November 2022. They are currently seeing around 1.5 million transactions per month. The CEO urges the community to consider the significant market share at risk before making RBF default enabled and encouraging full adoption.Overall, enabling experimentation on testnets and not touching mainnet until a later release seems like a good way to socialize the idea that zeroconf deprecation is happening and that businesses have a real deadline for migrating away from accepting unconfirmed txs if the risk of being defrauded concerns them. Feedback from businesses on policy changes is necessary before release candidates to avoid closed-off ways of doing things.</summary>
