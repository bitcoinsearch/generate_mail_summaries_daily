    <summary>The article is a discussion about the risks and benefits of zero-confirmation (0conf) transactions, which allow merchants to accept payments before they are confirmed on the blockchain. The author argues that responsible 0conf acceptance can be rational and trustworthy if merchants monitor and mitigate the risk of double-spending. However, the rise of replaceable transactions (29% of all transactions as of October 2022) poses a challenge to relying on first-seen transaction agreements. Relying on replaceable transactions in a system designed to enforce payment integrity is irrational and trusting, according to the author. The author also criticizes Replace-by-Fee (RBF), a feature that incentivizes rollbacks and uncertainty, for being baked deeper into Bitcoin despite having negative consequences for more popular use cases. Finally, the author suggests that facilitating replaceability for all transactions is a better solution than propping up the illusion of reliable payment promises.</summary>
