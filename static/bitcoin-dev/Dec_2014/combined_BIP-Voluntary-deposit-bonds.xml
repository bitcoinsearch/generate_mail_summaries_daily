    <summary>Sergio Lerner suggested a proposal to allow miners to voluntarily lock funds by adding inputs to the coinbase transaction. He proposed minimal modification of code by removing code instead of adding, which can be included in the next hardfork. However, Gavin's OP_EVAL (hard-fork) is better suited for the cause as it goes along the lines of Satoshi's original design. Sergio argued that Bitcoin needs to be simplified for new programmers to keep the project going. In response, it was stated that there is no "abuse" and the change suggested by Sergio has no purpose by itself. If the motivation is purely enabling different rules in a soft-fork, then nothing needs to be done. Instead, an unusual anyone can spend transaction can be provided in the block which pays to fees, and simultaneously add a soft-forking rule that makes that anyone can spend rule no longer anyone can spend. This anyone can pay transaction can be made a coinbase input. It was also mentioned that making coinbases have inputs is not a simple modification, as one of the inputs is already used as the special coinbase field, which must be specially handled.</summary>
