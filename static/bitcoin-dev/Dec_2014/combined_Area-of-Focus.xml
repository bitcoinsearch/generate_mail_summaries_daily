    <summary>Some Internet Service Providers (ISPs) are blocking DNS seeds which pick up IP addresses hosting Bitcoin core nodes that also run web servers, which can serve malware, causing the ISPs to block them. Automated methods used by ISPs often lead to inappropriate things being blocked, and moving off of DNS is not an option as it would compromise anonymity. A potential solution could be to support a subdomain that has results with an XORed constant mask to tweak the real IP, and to stuff a TXT/AAAA/whatever record with a signature of the results provided by the DNS seed operator. Will Bickford asks where he can help with Bitcoin core development in his spare time.</summary>
