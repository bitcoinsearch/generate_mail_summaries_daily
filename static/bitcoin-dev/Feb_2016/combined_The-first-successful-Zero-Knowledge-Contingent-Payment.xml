    <summary>The first successful Zero-Knowledge Contingent Payment (ZKCP) on the Bitcoin network was announced. ZKCP is a transaction protocol that allows a buyer to purchase information from a seller using Bitcoin in a manner which is private, scalable, secure, and which doesnâ€™t require trusting anyone. An example application would be the owners of a particular make of e-book reader cooperating to purchase the DRM master keys from a failing manufacturer. In today's transaction, 0.10 BTC was paid for a solution to a 16x16 Sudoku puzzle from Sean Bowe, a member of the Zcash team. The transfer involved two transactions. Almost all of the engineering work behind this ZKCP implementation was done by Sean Bowe.</summary>
