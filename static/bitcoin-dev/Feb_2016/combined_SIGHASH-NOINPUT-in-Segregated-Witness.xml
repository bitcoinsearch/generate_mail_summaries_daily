    <summary>In this discussion between Bitcoin developers, Joseph Poon is proposing a new segwit script type to maximize the safety and ease of future script enhancements. He emphasizes the importance of being "ruthless" about changes beyond the minimum necessary for safe deployment of segwit. He suggests that without-inputs SIGHASH flags should not be deployed without at least a fee-committing SIGHASH_ALL to avoid replay attacks. When writing up a BIP, he suggests calling attention to the vulnerability to replay. Gregory Maxwell agrees with constructing the proposal as a new segwit script type, and proposes a scenario where three transactions are involved: anchor, commitment, and penalty. The signature must commit to the outputs to ensure safety. He also notes the difficulty of committing to a fee in the lightning use case and agrees that the vulnerability to replay should be called out in the BIP.</summary>
