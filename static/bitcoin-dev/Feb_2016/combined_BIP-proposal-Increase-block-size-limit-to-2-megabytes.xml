    <summary>Gavin Andresen suggests that the block size limit be increased to 2,000,000 bytes, while maintaining the existing sigop limit and implementing a new high limit on signature hashing. He proposes combining these limits into a single weighted sum of 0.5*blocksize + 50*accurate_sigops + 0.001*sighash. However, he questions the reasoning behind setting the threshold at 75% instead of 95%, as it gives "veto power" to a single big solo miner or mining pool. Instead, if a 20% miner wants to veto the upgrade, they could use their hash power to vote for an upgrade but not mine anything on the new chain. This would result in only 55% mining the new 2MB chain with 45% of hashpower remaining on the old chain. With a non-consensus fork, Gavin suggests expecting people involved to potentially act in ways that aren't very gentlemanly, and guarding against it if one wants the fork to be anything other than a huge mess.</summary>
