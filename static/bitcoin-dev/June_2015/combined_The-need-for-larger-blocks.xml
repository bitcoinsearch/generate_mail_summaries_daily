    <summary>Pieter Wuille, a Bitcoin Core developer, has addressed the ongoing block size debate. He agrees that larger blocks will be necessary in the long term but fundamentally disagrees with the belief that fear for a change in economics should necessitate larger blocks. Wuille believes that if this is the case, then there is effectively no limit going forward.Wuille also points out that the economy will adapt to what is available and setting a precedent that increasing the block size "because of a need" is reasonable sets up the size to scale to whatever people want. Furthermore, he thinks that we should increase the block size because we believe it increases utility and understand the risks, not because we're afraid of what might happen if we don't hurry up.Wuille believes that demand for payments, in general, is nearly infinite and only a small portion of it will eventually fit on a blockchain. He is not afraid of this change or trying to stop it. Inaction leads to consistent fee pressure as the months tick on and system volume grows, thus leading to economic policy change which leads to market and software disruption.According to Wuille, if someone wants to change economic policy, that's fine. But they should be honest and admit they are arguing for a change, a delta from current market expectations and behavior. It is critical to first deal with what is, not what one wishes the world to be.</summary>
