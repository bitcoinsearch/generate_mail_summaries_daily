    <summary>In a proposal sent to the bitcoin-dev IRC room, Andrew suggested using sidechains as a means of scaling. However, experts like Pieter are against this method as it would result in slower, more complex transactions that require more and larger transactions, which increases the net extra load on all verifiers together. Most transactions would also require cross-chain transfers, which could be done through either atomic swaps or the 2way peg transfer mechanism.Atomic swaps would require multiple transactions and a medium delay, while the 2way peg transfer mechanism is very slow and reduces the security the recipient has to SPV. Both methods reduce the security of the system. Sidechains do not offer a direct means for solving any of the scaling problems Bitcoin has, but they provide a mechanism for easier experimentation so that new technology can be built and tested without needing to introduce a new currency first.Increasing the Bitcoin block size and using an SPV client is a much better solution if you are fine with the SPV security model. But ultimately, even SPV security relies on others being able to validate, and both sidechains and larger block sizes make that harder. Splitting up transactions into multiple chains doesn't stop someone from validating all chains, which results in the same validation workload as a full node with one chain and big blocks that store the same number of transactions per second.The author discusses the potential security risks and drawbacks associated with pruning nodes in Bitcoin transactions. They argue that it will be more difficult for regular people to analyze transaction history, as only NSA-style nodes will have access to a full history. The author also notes that decentralization is important for security and argues against increasing block sizes beyond 1 million bytes.Additionally, the author discusses the potential benefits of sidechains as a scaling solution, arguing that they could lead to a self-organizing network of chains with different communities forming their own local chains with low fees. The author plans to develop their proposed scaling methods using bitcoin-core and Blockstream's sidechains code.Overall, the author stresses the importance of decentralization and maintaining security in Bitcoin transactions. Pruned nodes (nodes that have less than 10 years of transactions on their hard drives) are bad for the network as they could have been compromised when doing the initial validation, resulting in a risk of denial of service attacks from the "archival" nodes.</summary>
