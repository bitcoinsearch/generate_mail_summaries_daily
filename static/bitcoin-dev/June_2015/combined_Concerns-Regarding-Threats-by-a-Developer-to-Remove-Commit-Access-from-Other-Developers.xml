    <summary>The email exchanges between Bitcoin developers discuss various issues related to the decision-making process for Bitcoin Core and consensus changes. Matt Corallo raises an objection to the assumption that technical persons make decisions based on personal networks, whereas Mike Hearn references Gregory's post on Reddit where he said he would revert Gavin's pull request if he were to do one for the block size change.Wladimir J. van der Laan explains that while there is a lot of decision-making ability for code changes, consensus changes are much more difficult and require a long discussion process. Pieter believes consensus rule changes should not be implemented without having very good expectations that the network will adopt them, as it is reckless from the point of view of maintainers. The group discusses the importance of maintaining consensus among the technical community when proposing hard forks, as they effectively ask users of the system to migrate to a new system.Bitcoin is not a democracy, as the full node security model is designed to minimize trust in other parties in the system. This works by validating as much as possible according to the consensus rules. There is no "majority vote" that can override things, even a majority of miners cannot steal your coins or produce more than the allowed subsidy, unless they convince others to change their software. Changing the rules should be possible if there is wide consensus, but nobody should feel forced to change their code against their will. Being able to push for a controversial change to the system sets an incredibly dangerous precedent about who is in charge of the system's rules. Avoiding controversial changes helps to avoid external and potentially invisible manipulation.However, sometimes changes to the consensus rules may be wanted. The presence of a bug is a good reason, and widespread agreement about one of the system's limitation is too. Technological growth in network bandwidth, processing power, and storage are good reasons why the system should be able to scale proportionally. The criteria for making changes in the system should be based on a clear super-majority of the people and businesses who are using Bitcoin the most.Nevertheless, there will always be resistance to any change that disrupts the way people have been doing things. Some of the resistance for bigger blocks is coming from contributors who are worried they won't be able to keep up with a bigger blockchain. They might not be able to run full nodes from their home network connections, or might not be able to run a full node and stream Game of Thrones, on their old raspberry pi machines.</summary>
