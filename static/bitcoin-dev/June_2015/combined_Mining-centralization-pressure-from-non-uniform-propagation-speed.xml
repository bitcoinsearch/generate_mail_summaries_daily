    <summary>Pieter Todd has created a simulator for Bitcoin mining that is more detailed than the one used by Gavin Andresen for his blog post. The simulator takes into account different block sizes, fees, difficulty adjustments, processing and mining delays, and simulates longer periods of time. It also supports links with different latency and bandwidth. Pieter's simulator shows that creating larger blocks results in centralisation pressure on the system and smaller miners lose relative income. However, if half of a block's income is due to fees, the effect becomes even stronger. The simulator does not take into account multiple blocks/relays competing for the same bandwidth or nodes being unable to process multiple blocks at once.</summary>
