    <summary>In a mailing list discussion, Russell O'Connor suggested that bytes in the witness are cheaper than those in the script pubkey. He argued there is a crossover point in data size where it will be more cost-effective to use witness data. However, he noted that this is true only with today's standardness constraints. Christopher Allen asked which is better for placing 64-bytes into the Bitcoin blockchain - a traditional OP_RETURN or a spent taproot transaction? He opined that the taproot method might be better, but wanted to hear all sides. Meanwhile, aj pointed out that with a data carrier entry in the annex, it would be possible to publish data with a single transaction, and that the txid commits to OP_RETURN output, so you must download all OP_RETURN data to validate a block's merkle tree, whereas you can partially validate a block without downloading witness data.</summary>
