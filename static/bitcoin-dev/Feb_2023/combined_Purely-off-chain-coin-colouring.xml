    <summary>A proposed BIP by Casey Rodarmor suggests using a technique to track the identity of individual satoshis throughout their lifetime, creating non-fungible tokens (NFTs) whose ownership can be transferred by a bitcoin transaction. The approach allows all the "inscription" data to be entirely off-chain, and owners can self-custody all the information about the things they own without having to rely on third parties. In a message posted on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Casey Rodarmor discussed the issue of ordinals and inscriptions, which he believes are not relevant to general Bitcoin development. AJ Towns responded by suggesting that moving inscriptions entirely off-chain would be plausible, citing benefits such as making small blocks cheap to verify bitcoin and decreasing demand for blockspace. However, there are concerns related to salience and scarcity, as well as the potential for NFT structures that could be difficult to prevent. For semi-fungible tokens, it was suggested that Liquid's multi-asset model may be superior to ordinals and inscriptions. The article discusses the issues with current NFT marketplaces that sell off-chain content and how users are not given tools to protect themselves. To make a digital asset site off-chain, the author suggests using a nostr relay with submissions gated by proof of work and no expiry.The author suggests treating any event that includes an "ordinal" tag as a digital asset and adding it to the digital asset database. Regular proof of work adjustments can be made targeting 200MB worth of events per day. Lightning-based patreon-type setups can also be added to allow content creators to post content to a closed relay, patrons pay a fee over lightning to receive events, and 90%+ of those fees are passed on to creators. Furthermore, the author thinks the term "inscription" is inappropriate for an off-chain NFT protocol because it has a connotation of permanence and an indelible association with a particular Satoshi. Despite being an off-chain NFT protocol, the "digital asset" includes the ordinal that controls ownership and is identified by the hash of its contents, including that ordinal's identity, so there is an indelible association with a particular Satoshi.</summary>
