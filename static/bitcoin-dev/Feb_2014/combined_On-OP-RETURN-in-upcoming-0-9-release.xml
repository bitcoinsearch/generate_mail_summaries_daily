    <summary>Andreas Petersson suggests that if a user wants to put extra data in the blockchain, OP_RETURN should be the superior alternative. He also believes that block propagation times will have a stronger effect on effective fees than dust-limit rules. Petersson thinks that a payload larger than the biggest multisig TX is the right answer, which would be &gt;= 64x3 bytes = 192 bytes. Jeff Garzik thinks that regular transactions should have the ability to include some metadata. However, there is a contradiction between his statement and his endorsement of chain data storage. Adoption of the practices matters too. If it turns out that encouraging people to use hashes is a lost cause, it can always be further relaxed in the future, going the other way is much harder.</summary>
