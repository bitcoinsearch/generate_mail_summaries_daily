    <summary>In 2013, Pieter Wuille corrected himself on the measurements for propagation delays of blocks used in C. Decker's paper. Pieter Wuille believed that C. Decker's paper used measurements for propagation delays for blocks 180000-190000, which happened between May and July 2012 using the latest bitcoind/bitcoin-qt release at the time, which was 0.6.3. However, data from blocks 20000-210000, September-November 2012, was used in the article. Although the patterns are valid, the actual speed numbers might be different now. At least the changes to 0.8 should impact propagation significantly. Michael Gronager used Decker et al.'s work to estimate the transaction fee size and optimal block size. The propagation of a block is roughly proportional to its size, and the slower a block propagates, the higher the risk of a fork. In other words, as a miner, you are juggling the risk of a fork vs the opportunity for including more transactions and getting those fees. The average propagation time for a block is t_propagate, and the average time between blocks is t_blocks. Those are roughly 10sec and 600sec, respectively. The risk of someone else mining a block before your block propagates is roughly P_fork = t_propagate/t_blocks (~1/60). Propagation time is a function of block size, S, where t_propagate = t_0 + alpha*S, and Decker et al have determined alpha to be 80ms/kb. The fee size per kilobyte, f, is defined as E_fee = f*S. Given these equations, the expected average earning is E = P_hashrate*(1 - P_fork)*(E_bounty + E_fees), and inserting this gives E = P_hashrate*[1 - (t_0 + alpha*S)/t_block]*(E_bounty + f*S). To choose the fee so that the more transactions included, the more earned, we need dE/dS &gt; 0. Gronager determined that f &gt; alpha*E_bounty/(t_block-t_0) ~ alpha*E_bounty/t_block or f &gt; 80*25/600000 = 0.0033 or assuming a standard transaction size of 0.227kb: f_tx &gt; 0.00076.The conclusion is that the current fee is too small, and there is no need to keep a maximum block size. The fork probability will automatically provide an incentive to not let blocks grow into infinity. The calculations should be done using the proper integrals and simulations, but Gronager left that for academia. A nice side effect of switching to broadcasting transactions in blocks as only their hash is that it decouples fee size from transaction size.</summary>
