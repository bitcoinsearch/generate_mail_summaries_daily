    <summary>Matt Corallo, a Bitcoin developer, has created a backup relay network to augment the existing P2P network. The system aims to act as a fallback in the case that the public Bitcoin network encounters issues and decrease block propagation times between miners. The relay network is open to everyone via a few public relay nodes, but will also have nodes made available only to large miners and merchants/exchanges to mitigate the ability of malicious parties to DoS the network.Interested parties can establish their own private peering agreements with large miners as needed. Currently, the network consists of one specially designed relay node, but more are expected to come online soon. To peer with the public relay nodes, one needs to select the closest region out of us-west (West Coast US), us-east (East Coast US), eu (Western Europe), au (Australia), or jpy (Japan) and add public.REGION.relay.mattcorallo.com to the addnode list. Each relay node allows connecting on either port 8334 or 8335. Connecting on port 8334 will relay only blocks, and port 8335 will relay both blocks and transactions.The relay nodes do some data verification to prevent DoS, but in order to keep the relay fast, they do not fully verify the data they are relaying. It is advised to never mine a block building on top of a relayed block without fully checking it with your own bitcoin validator. The relay nodes are not designed to ensure that someone never misses data and may fail to relay some transactions. They do not follow the standard inv-getdata-tx/block flow but instead relay transactions/blocks immediately after they have done cursory verification. They will all relay among themselves very quickly, so there is no advantage to peering with as many relay nodes as possible.Matt has urged that the relay network is not designed to in any way replace or decrease the need for the public Bitcoin P2P network. It is not any kind of attempt at centralization, and he still encourages interested parties to establish their own private peering agreements with large miners as needed. The relay nodes are only there to augment the existing P2P network.If you're a merchant/exchange/large miner/other important node operator and wish to gain access to additional domain names that map to relay nodes with fewer peers, fill out the form at https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1UL82QdcXXEhZwSHJAK04Sk_cWg4zLOu8a216nO7Mt8c/viewform. The source for the relay nodes can be found at https://github.com/TheBlueMatt/RelayNode. If there are any comments/concerns/suggestions, email bitcoin-peering at mattcorallo.com.There has been extensive discussion on #bitcoin-wizards as well as #bitcoin-dev of the very small number of active, listening nodes. Users who wish to gain access to additional domain names which map to relay nodes with fewer peers can fill out the form at https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1UL82QdcXXEhZwSHJAK04Sk_cWg4zLOu8a216nO7Mt8c/viewform.The relay nodes do not follow the standard inv-getdata-tx/block flow, but instead relay transactions/blocks immediately after they have done their cursory verification. They keep some track of whether or not users' nodes claim to have seen the transactions/blocks before relaying, but users may see transactions/blocks being sent which they already have and have not requested. The relay nodes will all relay among themselves very quickly; therefore, there is no advantage to peering with as many relay nodes as possible.In the event of an attack, DoS attack by flooding blocks is fundamentally more difficult than a DoS attack by flooding transactions, so doing the split by IP address ensures that in the event of an attack, the more important block relaying functionality is less likely to be damaged. In the meantime, both DNS addresses point to the same IP until it becomes an issue.The transactions relayed are piped through a bitcoind first and for blocks, bitcoinj does SPV-validation. It is possible to create a block that passes SPV validation but causes a DoS score, but doing so would cost a miner a full block's worth of profits, which they are fairly unlikely to do.</summary>
