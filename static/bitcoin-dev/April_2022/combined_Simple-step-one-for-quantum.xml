    <summary>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is expected to publish the results of the Post-Quantum Cryptography competition soon. The results were initially expected by the end of March, but it appears that they will be released by the end of April instead. NTRU and NTRU Prime have both made it to round 3 for public key encryption/exchange and digital signature categories, but both are currently involved in some sort of patent controversy. Meanwhile, Erik Aronesty via bitcoin-dev has suggested implementing a similar address type (secp26k1+NTRU) and associated validation as a soft fork to create quantum safe addresses. Nodes would need to perform extra validation work, but a fee premium could be added to address this concern. However, Aronesty believes that implementing this idea might be "putting the cart like six and a half miles in front of the horse". Regardless, if there is sufficient support, Aronesty is willing to make an NTRU bip.</summary>
