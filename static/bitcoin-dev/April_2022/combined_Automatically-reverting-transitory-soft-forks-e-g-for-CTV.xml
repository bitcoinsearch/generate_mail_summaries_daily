    <summary>David A. Harding and Matt Corallo recently discussed the implementation of covenants in Bitcoin on the bitcoin-dev mailing list. While Corallo suggested exploring different design tradeoffs and considering real-world use cases, Harding doubted the feasibility of assigning objective weights to different designs and proposed using data on user adoption and fees to choose which design to implement. The conversation also touched upon the risks associated with conducting a fork and the lack of interest in researching serious covenant designs from highly-qualified individuals. James O'Beirne expressed his support for CTV as a simple covenant system that has undergone significant review compared to other proposals. However, there were criticisms against CTV, including concerns about usage and maintenance burden, as well as uncertainty around whether it is the best approach for covenants. The technical community needs to determine which design will work best by gathering real usage data and optimizing for demonstrated needs. Some argue that activating CTV at this stage is myopic and sets a poor precedent for changes to Bitcoin's culture of security and careful design. The Bitcoin technical community still hasn't reached consensus around any concrete proposal for covenants, making it premature to discuss activating CTV.Matt argued that they should be designing something that is flexible, useful, and private, rather than just looking at whether CTV or any other system gets usage. He suggested that things should be added to Bitcoin only if there are some demonstrated use-cases and intent to use the change, and because it's aligned with Bitcoin's design and goals based on developer and broader community response, and because the technical folks who have/are willing to spend time working on the specific design space think the concrete proposal is the best design they have. Another member of the group suggested mitigating the concerns by making CTV an automatically reverting consensus change with an option to renew. This would allow experimenting with new features without committing themselves to live with them forever, but the downside of this approach is that it creates a big footgun. Miners would be incentivized to censor spends of the reverting opcode near its reversion date, and there is a bias towards keeping the change.</summary>
