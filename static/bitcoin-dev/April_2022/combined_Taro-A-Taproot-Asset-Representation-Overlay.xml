    <summary>Laolu has designed and published a new protocol called Taro, which allows for issuing assets on Bitcoin's main chain using Taproot script tree. The Taro design utilizes a hybrid merkle tree, called Merkle Sum Sparse Merkle Tree (MS-SMT), that commits extra asset structured meta data to enable easily verifiable asset supply proofs and efficient proofs of non-existence.Asset transfers are embedded in a virtual transaction graph, which uses a chain of asset witnesses to track the transfer of assets across taproot outputs. The Taro design also supports integration with the Lightning Network. Taro also has a scripting system, which allows for programmatic unlocking/transfer of assets.Taro issuance is limited to a single event rather than potentially multiple events over time subject to special per-asset rules. The Taro script is not enforced by Bitcoin, meaning those who control the Bitcoin script can always choose to ignore the Taro script and destroy the Taro assets as a result. However, there exists an incentive for the holder of an asset to observe the Taro validation rules.By relying on the existing taproot commitment structure/derivation, Taro implementations are able to re-use surrounding code/libraries, making a core implementation more compact. The Taro protocol utilizes the Lightning Network as a backbone, and Taro asset transfers are seen as normal Bitcoin transfers by internal routers.The Taro suite consists of several BIPs, including the Taro protocol, the MS-SMT structure, the Taro VM, the Taro address format, the Taro Universe concept, and the Taro flat file proof format. The Taro protocol enables trust-minimized issuance of assets on Bitcoin, resolving issues related to double spending or duplicate assets.When transferring Taro token ownership from one Bitcoin UTXO to another, UTXOs generated are just the ones part of the MIMO transaction. The sparse merkle tree in the Taro design serves several purposes such as non-inclusion proofs, history independence, and ensuring uniqueness of certain items/commitments. The Taro commitment impact the final derived taproot output key.Laolu, the designer of the Taro protocol, is updating the draft to better spell things out regarding the Taro protocol's verification of provenance of asset UTXOs. In terms of wallets, constructing a taproot tree given a set of script leaves can be done with a Taro library, but there is a missing standardized algorithm for this process. Overall, Taro enables trust-minimized issuance of assets on Bitcoin, and its design allows for different ways of expressing change/UTXOs and ensures uniqueness of certain items/commitments. Any privacy enhancing protocol used for on-chain top-level Bitcoin UTXOs can also be applied to Taro.</summary>
