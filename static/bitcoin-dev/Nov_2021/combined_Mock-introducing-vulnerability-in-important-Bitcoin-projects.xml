    <summary>In a recent email thread among Bitcoin developers, the importance of testing and verifying the review process in open-source Bitcoin projects was discussed. One participant proposed an exercise to test the review process by creating pull requests with vulnerabilities on three Bitcoin projects - Bitcoin Core, LND, and Bisq - over the next six months. The aim was to improve the review process and make Bitcoin more secure. However, another participant warned that this exercise may come at the expense of existing open-source contributors and suggested checking first whether the plan is appreciated.Later in September 2021, Prayank proposed a similar exercise to test the review process of the same three Bitcoin projects. If caught during review, they would announce it publicly, but if not, they would privately reveal both the inserted vulnerability and the review failure. The email conversation also delved into the importance of regularly testing and verifying open-source Bitcoin project code and the possibility of testing the review process against attacks. The email concludes with a rephrased tweet emphasizing the importance of independent thought during the review process. However, one moderator advised caution due to the controversial nature of the proposed exercise and its potential negative impact on existing open-source contributors.In November 2021, Prayank announced the exercise to test the review process of the three Bitcoin projects mentioned earlier. The plan was to create pull requests with vulnerabilities in these projects over the next six months using a salted hashed username. If caught during review, Prayank would announce it publicly, but if not, they would privately reveal both the inserted vulnerability and the review failure. The email conversation emphasized the importance of independent thought during the review process and discussed various methods to test the review process against attacks. The author acknowledged that their exercise may have different results than those of active developers due to uneven reputation factors and review attention.As of yet, there has been no public report on the results of the exercise, leaving it unclear whether a vulnerability has been introduced in one or all of the named projects. The discussion highlights the importance of testing and verifying open-source Bitcoin project code regularly to ensure the security of the cryptocurrency.</summary>
