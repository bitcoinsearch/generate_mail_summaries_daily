    <summary>A developer named n1ms0s is working on a fork of Bitcoinj with basic Taproot support. The fork supports sending and receiving with Taproot addresses using a Bitcoinj SPV wallet, along with public/private key tweaking. However, when broadcasting a Taproot transaction to older nodes (old as in ~0.18.0), the developer receives an error response of "Witness version reserved for soft-fork upgrades". The issue has been raised on Stack Exchange for assistance. Prior to version 0.19.0, creating outputs with an unknown witness version was considered non-standard and violated BIP 173. This issue was addressed and fixed for version 0.19.0+ in PR #15846. It's suggested that the problem with getting P2TR spends to relay might be rejected by all post-SegWit pre-Taproot Bitcoin Core releases.</summary>
