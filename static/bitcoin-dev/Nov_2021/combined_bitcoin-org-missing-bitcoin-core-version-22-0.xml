    <summary>On October 20th, Owen Gunden via bitcoin-dev expressed concern that Wladimir is no longer signing releases and that he has no trust in the gpg network of people who seem to have replaced him. However, this claim is not true as attestations by Wladimir can be found on the 22.0 release. The build attestations (by anyone) can now be used as a trust basis instead of a separate special release key. Bitcoin Core's official website has been bitcoincore.org for several years, and binaries have not been posted to bitcoin.org by the release maintainer for several major releases. In a blog post shared by Prayank, there were discussions on how to improve decentralization in Bitcoin, including having more people use alternative full node implementations, having more contributors from different countries, and individuals and organizations funding different Bitcoin projects should consider contributing to alternative full node implementations as well. The post also mentioned that irrational optimism is as toxic as irrational pessimism. Mercedes Catherine Salazar advised Owen not to worry and to build his own release, always verifying the tree hash and trusting signed annotated tags.</summary>
