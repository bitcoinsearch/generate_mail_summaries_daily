    <summary>A user named Drak asked why a particular file was made available for download at sourceforge.net if it wasn't actually released. In response, it was explained that there is a process involved in releasing files, which includes putting them up, propagating to mirrors, and checking by multiple people that the downloads work and the signatures pass. Every release comes with a release announcement, so one will know when it's out when they see the announcement. The alternative would be to hide the files in the release pipeline, but this would allow less public participation in the release workflow.Drak claimed that the file had already been released and could be found all over bitcointalk/reddit. However, it was clarified that it had not yet been released, but rather queued for announcement. The team was waiting for another independent gitian build before sending out the announcement.</summary>
