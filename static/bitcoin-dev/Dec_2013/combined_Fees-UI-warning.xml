    <summary>The discussion starts with Wladimir's suggestion of using deterministic wallets to make backups optional and replacing the importing of private keys by a "sweep" function. Another suggestion is made by an anonymous user, adding structured key-management, which would allow users to hit a "retire keys / keys possibly compromised" button that would create a new seed, force the user to make a backup, then switch to the new seed and move all their coins. However, Mike Hearn raises the concern that badly designed software will always be a danger, and suggests that education efforts are necessary to encourage people not to use dangerous services. Finally, Jim announces that for the HD version of MultiBit, the import of individual private keys will be removed entirely and only supporting HD addresses primarily for safety reasons.</summary>
